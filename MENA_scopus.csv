To leverage PV modules at full extent, it is desirable that it has high efficiency. However, increased module temperature is one of the main factors that cause lower module efficiency. Studies have shown that wind has a positive impact on decreasing module temperatures and thus increasing its efficiency. This paper analyzes the effect of wind speed and its direction on south-facing PV module efficiency. One year data was considered for this study which was collected at the outdoor test facility of Dubai Electricity and Water Authority R&D Center. Visual inspection of the sampled data collected in summer and winter as well as transient analysis showed high wind speeds ranging from 6 to 13 m/s coming from south direction can reduce module temperature by more than 8°C. The transient model analysis proved the relation is inversely proportional and nonlinear.  © 2023 IEEE.","","Solar panels; Wind; Desert climates; Economic impacts; Environment impact; Free standings; Module efficiency; Module temperature; Performance; Photovoltaic modules; Speed effect; Wind speed; Transient analysis","","","","","","","IEA, Sola PV Global Supply Chains, (2022); Waterworth D., Armstrong A., Southerly winds increase the electricity generated by solar photovoltaic systems, Solar Energy, 202, pp. 123-135, (2020); Vasel A., Iakovidis F., The effect of wind direction on the performance of solar PV plants, Energy Convers Manag, 153, pp. 455-461, (2017); Mustafa R.J., Gomaa M.R., Al-Dhaifallah M., Rezk H., Environmental impacts on the performance of solar photovoltaic systems, Sustainability, 12, 2, (2020); Mondol J.D., Yohanis Y., Smyth M., Norton B., Long term performance analysis of a grid connected photovoltaic system in northern ireland, Energy Convers Manag, 47, 18-19, pp. 2925-2947, (2006); Rehman S., El-Amin I., Performance evaluation of an off-grid photovoltaic system in saudi arabia, Energy, 46, 1, pp. 451-458, (2012); Park K.E., Kang G.H., Kim H.I., Yu G.J., Kim J.T., Analysis of thermal and electrical performance of semi-transparent photovoltaic (PV) module, Energy, 35, 6, pp. 2681-2687, (2010); Hasan A., McCormack S.J., Huang M.J., Norton B., Evaluation of phase change materials for thermal regulation enhancement of building integrated photovoltaics, Solar Energy, 84, 9, pp. 1601-1612, (2010); Ma T., Yang H., Zhang Y., Lu L., Wang X., Using phase change materials in photovoltaic systems for thermal regulation and electrical efficiency improvement: A review and outlook, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 43, pp. 1273-1284, (2015); Dwivedi P., Sudhakar K., Soni A., Solomin E., Kirpichnikova I., Advanced cooling techniques of P.V. modules: A state of art, Case Studies in Thermal Engineering, 21, (2020); Hussien A., Eltayesh A., El-Batsh H.M., Experimental and numerical investigation for PV cooling by forced convection, Alexandria Engineering Journal, 64, pp. 427-440, (2023); Shahsavar A., Salmanzadeh M., Ameri M., Talebizadeh P., Energy saving in buildings by using the exhaust and ventilation air for cooling of photovoltaic panels, Energy Build, 43, 9, pp. 2219-2226, (2011); Masalha I., Masuri S.U., Badran O.O., Ariffin M.K.A.M., Talib A.R.A., Alfaqs F., Outdoor experimental and numerical simulation of photovoltaic cooling using porous media, Case Studies in Thermal Engineering, 42, (2023); Nabil T., Mansour T.M., Augmenting the performance of photovoltaic panel by decreasing its temperature using various cooling techniques, Results in Engineering, 15, (2022); Bilen K., Erdogan I., Effects of cooling on performance of photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) solar panels: A comprehensive review, Solar Energy, 262, (2023); Patil M., Sidramappa A., Shetty S.K., Hebbale A.M., Experimental study of solar PV/T panel to increase the energy conversion efficiency by air cooling, Mater Today Proc, (2023); Chapter 3 [CE]: General Requirements, (2015); Jones A.D., Underwood C.P., A thermal model for photovoltaic systems, Solar Energy, 70, 4, (2001)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","1st Middle East and North Africa Solar Conference, MENA-SC 2023","15 November 2023 through 18 November 2023","Dubai","196124","","978-166549146-4","","","English","Middle East North Africa Sol.

Agrivoltaics allows the dual use of land by integrating photovoltaic (PV) systems and crops. In hot and arid climates, the solar panels provide shade to the crops, and the water used for cleaning the panels can be used for irrigation. In this work, we investigated an agrivoltaic system with mono-facial PV modules to assess shade-tolerant cucumbers' growth under and outside PV s in October, when it is hard to grow crops under direct sunlight in the hot arid climate of the UAE. The tilt of the module was 25°, and the height of the module was 1.5 m. Our results showed that all growth and fruit production parameters were significantly greater in the shaded area and significantly less mortality than in the site exposed to sunlight. A negative correlation was observed between the growth and production parameters and the distance from the center of the panels. The results show that the development of agrivoltaics is a very promising approach to ensuring the sustainable security of energy and food in the hot arid lands of the UAE.  © 2023 IEEE.","","Energy security; Food supply; Population statistics; Solar panels; Clean energy; Dual use; Energy; Food security; Hot and arid climates; Photovoltaic systems; Production parameters; Rapid growth; Water security; World population; Crops","","","","","","","Sekiyama T., Nagashima A., Solar sharing for both food and clean energy production: Performance of agrivoltaic systems for corn, a typical shade-intolerant crop, Environments, 6, 6, (2019); Yasmeen R., Yao X., Padda I.U.H., Shah W.U.H., Jie W., Exploring the role of solar energy and foreign direct investment for clean environment: Evidence from top 10 solar energy consuming countries, Renew.

Despite the significant progress in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), understanding their behavior in practical settings is crucial due to the unusual temperature-dependent effect of bandgap. Unlike traditional semiconductors, the band gap (Eg) of perovskites increases with temperature. Although the bandgap temperature dependence for traditional solar cells is well-documented, there is a lack of literature review and single-source data for existing perovskite absorbers. Accordingly, this study consolidates scattered data from literature to provide a comprehensive dataset of temperature coefficient-dependent band gaps of perovskites. The collected data is categorized based on cations and halides, material morphology, and temperature ranges. By presenting this consolidated data, the research aims to facilitate the development and optimization of single junction and multijunction perovskite devices, ultimately contributing to the advancement of efficient and stable perovskite-based photovoltaic technologies for various applications.  © 2023 IEEE.","","Energy gap; Perovskite solar cells; Temperature distribution; Cell-be; Cell/B.E; Cell/BE; Optoelectronics property; Photovoltaic devices; Real operating conditions; Temperature coefficient; Temperature dependence; Temperature dependent; Temperature-dependent effects; Perovskite","","","","","","","De Wolf S., Holovsky J., Moon S.J., Loper P., Niesen B., Ledinsky M., Haug F.J., Yum J.H., Ballif C., Organometallic halide perovskites: Sharp optical absorption edge and its relation to photovoltaic performance, J.

Triple cation-based perovskite (CsFAPbIBr) is integrated with polished silicon heterojunction solar cells, considering variations in MgF2 antireflective coating (ARC) properties and angle of incidence. The optimized device architecture, validated with experimental results, exhibits a baseline dark blue reflected color with promising Jsc and Voc values. The produced spectrum of colors from parametric analysis of ARC shows a range of gamut from brown to blue to green. Maximum power penalty or loss is observed at 5.5% for the 4-terminal configuration under perpendicular light incidence relative to baseline. However, the power penalty increased to 8.6% for the 2-terminal device configuration for high saturation and vivid colors. Higher degrees of incidence angles result in colorful devices but increased performance losses.

The inner distribution of resistivity, which corresponds to different resistivity properties of different tissues, is estimated from voltage potentials measured on the boundary of inspected object. The major problem of EIT is how to reconstruct the image of inner resistivity. There are many approaches to solve this issue, which require more computational demands. The use of neural network to solve this non-linear problem addresses the demand to ease the implementation and lower the computational demands. In this article we adopted the use of Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network for image reconstruction and compared it to reconstructed images obtained using EIDORS software. RBF network was created and trained using the Matlab and neural network toolbox. As training data the simulated measurement voltages and EIDORS difference reconstruction gained values of model elements were used as input and output vectors.

High temperatures can lead to hot air rapidly rising and forming a spinning column of air known as 'dust devils' carrying fine sand particles and debris several meters into the air. In this work, we designed a sand trap device to collect sand from different heights, especially during dust devils. Additionally, sand was also collected from different locations around Dubai from both modules and ground to analyse the particle size distribution. This study assisted the assessment of distinct abrasive effects associated with coarse and fine sand particles during sandstorms, thereby improving our understanding of their impact on PV modules installed in arid regions.  © 2023 IEEE.","Particle Size Distribution; PV Solar Parks; Sand and Dust; Scanning Electron Microscopy","Dust; Light transmission; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Sand; Size distribution; Solar energy; Solar panels; Solar power generation; Storms; Dust devils; Fine sand; Irradiance level; Particles-size distributions; Photovoltaic solar park; Photovoltaics; Sand and dust; Sand particles; Solar irradiances; Solar parks; Scanning electron microscopy","","","","","","","Kazem H.A., Chaichan M.T., Al-Waeli A.H.A., Sopian K., A review of dust accumulation and cleaning methods for solar photovoltaic systems, Journal of Cleaner Production, 276, (2020); Ilse K., Micheli L., Figgis B.W., Lange K., Dassler D., Hanifi H., Wolfertstetter F., Naumann V., Hagendorf C., Gottschalg R., Bagdahn J., Techno-economic assessment of soiling losses and mitigation strategies for solar power generation, Joule, 3, 10, pp. 2303-2321, (2019); Nowak S., Lafon S., Caquineau S., Journet E., Laurent B., Quantitative study of the mineralogical composition of mineral dust aerosols by X-ray diffraction, Talanta, 186, pp. 133-139, (2018); Bazarbayev R., Zhou B., Allaniyazov A., Zeng G., Mamedov D., Ivanitskaya E., Wei Q., Qian H., Yakubov K., Ghali M., Karazhanov S., Physical and chemical properties of dust in the pre-aral region of Uzbekistan, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 29, 27, pp. 40893-40902, (2022); Fan S., Wang X., Cao S., Wang Y., Zhang Y., Liu B., A novel model to determine the relationship between dust concentration and energy conversion efficiency of photovoltaic (PV) panels, Energy, 252, (2022); Ives R.L., Behavior of dust devils, Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 28, 4, pp. 168-174, (1947); Lorenz R.D., Balme M.R., Gu Z., Kahanpaa H., Klose M., Kurgansky M.V., Patel M.R., Reiss D., Rossi A.P., Spiga A., Takemi T., Wei W., History and applications of dust devil studies, Space Sciences Series of ISSI, pp. 5-37, (2017); Basaran M., Uzun O., Cornelis W., Gabriels D., Erpul G., Potential use of best® sediment trap in splash - saltation transport process by simultaneous wind and rain tests, PLoS ONE, 11, 11, (2016)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","1st Middle East and North Africa Solar Conference, MENA-SC 2023","15 November 2023 through 18 November 2023","Dubai","196124","","978-166549146-4","","","English","Middle East North Africa Sol.

However, dust could significantly hamper the efficacy of solar devices. The impact of aerosols on, e.g., photovoltaic (PV) panels is twofold. Firstly, aerosols suspended in the atmosphere attenuate solar radiation reducing the downward solar flux at the surface. Secondly, dust and other aerosols deposit on the optically active surfaces of solar devices, decreasing their efficacy. The total loss can be calculated as a sum of soiling and attenuation losses. This study investigates the impact of coarse and fine dust particles on the PV panels' efficacy using WRF-Chem model simulations and observations of dust deposition, aerosol optical depth, and incoming solar irradiances. Fine dust particles with radii r < 3 um are mainly responsible for significantly reducing the downward solar flux. However, dust mass deposition on PV panels is primarily linked to coarse particles with r > 3 um. The average surface solar radiation decrease caused by dust over the Arabian Peninsula is more than 10 W m-2. Still, locally, it exceeds 40 W m-2. Thus, the average daily attenuation loss is about 3-4%, but locally reaches 10-12 %. The deposited particles are densely packed on the surface of a PV panel, and the Mie theory is not applicable to evaluate their radiative effect. Here we suggest that deposited particles make a uniform layer over a solar panel surface. The estimate of soiling losses based on this assumption agrees with observations, suggesting that soiling losses are caused mainly by coarse dust. The average soiling losses over the Arabian Peninsula are accumulating at about 12% per week, while on the east coast, it reaches 30-35%.  © 2023 IEEE.","","Aerosols; Air quality; Deposition; Solar panels; Solar radiation; Attenuation loss; Dust particle; Dust sources; Fine dusts; Human health; Middle East; Optically Active; Photovoltaic panels; Solar flux; Source region; Dust","","","","","","","Adebiyi A.A., Kok J.K.F., Climate models miss most of the coarse dust in the atmosphere, Science advances, 6, 15, (2020); Anisimov A., Axisa D., Kucera P., Mostamandi S., Stenchikov G., Observations and cloud-resolving modeling of haboob dust storms over the arabian peninsula, Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres, 123, 21, pp. 12-147, (2018); Prakash J., Stenchikov G., Kalenderski S., Osipov S., Bangalath H., The impact of dust storms on the arabian peninsula and the red sea, Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, 15, 1, pp. 199-222, (2015); Kalenderski S.S., Stenchikov G., High-resolution regional modeling of summertime transport and impact of african dust over the red sea and arabian peninsula, Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres, 121, 11, pp. 6435-6458, (2016); Osipov S., Stenchikov G., Simulating the regional impact of dust on the middle east climate and the red sea, Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans, 123, 2, pp. 1032-1047, (2018); Osipov S., Stenchikov G., Brindley H., Banks J., Diurnal cycle of the dust instantaneous direct radiative forcing over the arabian peninsula, Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, 15, 16, pp. 9537-9553, (2015); Balkanski Y., Schulz M., Claquin T., Guibert S., Reevaluation of mineral aerosol radiative forcings suggests a better agreement with satellite and aeronet data, Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, 7, 1, pp. 81-95, (2007); Engelbrecht J., Stenchikov G., Prakash J., Lersch T., Anisimov A., Shevchenko I.G., Physical and chemical properties of deposited airborne particulates over the Arabian red sea coastal plain, Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, 17, 18, pp. 11467-11490, (2017); Prakash J., Stenchikov G., Tao W., Yapici T., Warsama B., Engelbrecht J., Arabian red sea coastal soils as potential mineral dust sources, Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, 16, 18, pp. 11991-12004, (2016); Shevchenko I., Engelbrecht J., Mostamandi S.S., Stenchikov G., Evaluation of minerals being deposited in the red sea using gravimetric, size distribution, and mineralogical analysis of dust deposition samples collected along the red sea coastal plain, Aeolian Research, 52, (2021); Valerino M., Bergin M., Ghoroi C., Ratnaparkhi A., Smestad G., Low-cost solar pv soiling sensor validation and size resolved soiling impacts: A comprehensive field study in western India, Solar Energy, 204, pp. 307-315, (2020); Ilse K., Figgis B., Naumann V., Hagendorf C., Bagdahn J.J., Fundamentals of soiling processes on photovoltaic modules, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 98, pp. 239-254, (2018); Ilse K., Figgis B., Werner M., Naumann V., Hagendorf C., Poanllmann H., Bagdahn J., Comprehensive analysis of soiling and cementation processes on PV modules in Qatar, Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells, 186, pp. 309-323, (2018); Grell G., Peckham S., Schmitz R., McKeen S., Frost G., Skamarock W., Eder B., Fully coupled ""online"" chemistry within the WRF model, Atmospheric Environment, 39, 37, pp. 6957-6975, (2005); Landau L., Bell J., Kearsley M., Pitaevskii L., Lifshitz E., Sykes J., Electrodynamics of continuous media, 8, (2013); Boyle L., Flinchpaugh H., Hannigan M., Impact of natural soiling on the transmission of pv cover plates, 2013 IEEE 39th photovoltaic specialists conference (pvsc), pp. 3276-3278, (2013); Mostamandi S., Ukhov A., Engelbrecht J.P., Et al., Fine and coarse dust effects on radiative forcing, mass deposition, and solar devices over the middle east, ESS Open Archive., (2023)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","1st Middle East and North Africa Solar Conference, MENA-SC 2023","15 November 2023 through 18 November 2023","Dubai","196124","","978-166549146-4","","","English","Middle East North Africa Sol.

This paper aims to analyze and identify the discoloration patterns forming on PV modules due to encapsulant material degradation at three different tilt angles. It was observed that the tilt angle directly influences the discoloration patterns formation in the PV modules. In the UV fluorescence images, modules installed at 25° tilt angle showed maximum discoloration in comparison to other tilt angles. The discoloration of encapsulant material directly influences shortcircuit current in the PV modules. The average annual degradation rate of short circuit current (Isc) for the frame pattern is 0.155%/year and the filled pattern is 0.273%/year. The rate was maximum at 25° tilt angle for both frame and filled patterns. Additionally, the Raman spectra also exhibited a direct relationship between discoloration and fluorescence background as 25° tilt angle showed maximum intensity. Overall, this study helps in finding the discoloration modes of the PV module's bill of materials at different tilt angles and can thereby be used to modify the encapsulant materials for desert PV module applications.  © 2023 IEEE.","Degradation; Discoloration pattern; Encapsulant; Fluorescence; PV modules","Discoloration; Fluorescence; Solar panels; Discoloration pattern; Encapsulant materials; Encapsulants; Materials degradation; Middle East; Pattern forming; Performance; PV modules; Short-circuit currents; Tilt angle; Degradation","","","","","","","Lelievre J.F., Couderc R., Pinochet N., Sicot L., Munoz D., Kopecek R., Ferrada P., Marzo A., Olivares D., Valencia F., Urrejola E., Desert label development for improved reliability and durability of photovoltaic modules in harsh desert conditions, Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells., 236, (2022); Adothu B., Bhatt P., Zele S., Oderkerk J., Costa F.R., Mallick S., Investigation of newly developed thermoplastic polyolefin encapsulant principle properties for the c-Si PV module application, Mater Chem Phys., 243, (2020); Adothu B., Kumar S., Jackel B., Muttumthala N.L., Shekason Z., Dassler D., Chapaneri K., Gabbadi P., Kumar Y., Alheloo A., Almheiri A., John J.J., Mathiak G., Alberts V., Gottschalg R., Identification and investigation of materials degradation in photovoltaic modules from middle east hot desert, Submitted EUPVSEC, (2023); Adothu B., Chattopadhyay S., Bhatt P., Hui P., Costa F.R., Mallick S., Early-stage identification of encapsulants photobleaching and discoloration in crystalline silicon photovoltaic module laminates, Progress in Photovoltaics: Research and Applications., (2020); Adothu B., Bhatt P., Chattopadhyay S., Zele S., Oderkerk J., Sagar H.P., Costa F.R., Mallick S., Newly developed thermoplastic polyolefin encapsulant-A potential candidate for crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules encapsulation, Solar Energy., 194, pp. 581-588, (2019)","B.

The PSCs with 1 vOlo Au@SnO2 ETL significantly enhanced the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PSCs from 16.23% to 18.43% due to the improvement in short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF). Moreover, the Au@SnO2-based hybrid E TL significantly reduced the nonradiative recombination losses and improved the carrier transport and extraction at the E TL/perovskite interface.  © 2023 IEEE.","","Conversion efficiency; Electron transport properties; Gold compounds; Perovskite; Plasmonics; Core-shell hybrids; Electron transport layers; Fill-factor; Nonradiative recombination; Optical and electrical properties; Photovoltaic devices; Plasmonic nanoparticle; Plasmonics; Power conversion efficiencies; Short circuit current density; Perovskite solar cells","","","","","","","Parida B., Singh A., Soopy A.K.K., Sangaraju S., Sundaray M., Mishra S., Liu S., Najar A., Recent developments in upscalable printing techniques for perovskite solar cells, Advanced Science, 9, (2022); Kojima A., Teshima K., Shirai Y., Miyasaka T., Organometal halide perovskites as visible-light sensitizers for photovoltaic cells, Journal of American Chemical Society, 131, pp. 6050-6051, (2009); Jeong J., Kim M., Seo J., Lu H., Ahlawat P., Mishra A., Yang Y., Hope M.A., Eickemeyer F.T., Kim M., Yoon Y.J., Choi I.W., Darwich B.P., Choi S.J., Jo Y., Lee J.H., Walker B., Zakeeruddin S.M., Emsley L., Rothlisberger U., Hagfeldt A., Kim D.S., Gratzel M., Kim J.Y., Pseudo-halide anion engineering for α-FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells, Nature, 592, pp. 381-385, (2021); Kulkarni S.A., Baikie T., Boix P.P., Yantara N., Mathews N., Mhaisalkar S., Band-gap tuning of lead halide perovskites using sequential deposition process, Journal of Materials Chemistry A, 2, pp. 9221-9225, (2014); Chen B., Zheng X., Bai Y., Padture N.P., Huang J., Progress in tandem solar cells based on hybris organic-inorganic perovskite, Advanced Energy Materials, 7, (2017); best research-cell efficiencies chart, (2023); Kumar N.S., Naidu K.C.B., A review on perovskite solar cells (PSCs), materials and applications, Journal of Materiomics, 7, pp. 940-956, (2021); Zhao D.-W., Yu M.-Y., Zheng L.-L., Dai S.-J., Chen D.-C., Lee T.-C., Yun D.-Q., Enhanced efficiency and stability of planar perovskite solar cells using a dual electron transport layer of gold nanoparticles embedded in anatase TiO2 films, ACS Applied Energy Materials, 3, pp. 9568-9575, (2020); Moakhar R.S., Gholipour S., Masudy-Panah S., Seza A., Mehdikhani A., Riahi-Noori N., Tafazoli S., Timasi N., Lim Y.-F., Saliba M., Recent advances in plasmonic perovskite solar cells, Advanced Science, 7, (2020); Song H.-M., Chon B.-S., Jeon S.-H., Rai P., Yu Y.-T., Dutta P.K., Synthesis of au@sno2 core-shell nanoparticles with controllable shell thickness and their co sensing properties, Materials Chemistry and Physics, 166, pp. 87-94, (2015); Singh T., Oz S., Sasinka A., Frohnhoven R., Mathur S., Miyasaka T., Sulfate-assisted interfacial engineering for high yield and efficiency of triple cation perovskite solar cells with alkali-doped electron-transport layers, Advanced Functional Materials, 28, (2018); Parida B., Yoon S., Ryu J., Hayase S., Jeong S.M., Kang D.-W., Boosting the conversion efficiency over 20% in MAPbI3 perovskite planar solar cells by employing a solution-processed aluminum-doped nickel oxide hole collector, ACS Applied Materials Interfaces, 12, pp. 22958-22970, (2020)","B.

The assessment is based on the yearly PVSD energy generation and building energy demand and the daylight performance of different facades during different times of the day and seasons of the year. The results show that in terms of generation, the south facade provides 43.5 MWh of energy. In terms of daylight, PVSD on the south facade reduces the average illuminance in the building to almost half of its value during the summer solstice and march equinox. In terms of thermal energy performance when put on the south facade of this model of a medium office building, offset 68.51 % of the cooling load of the south perimeter zone. As predicted the PVSD in the south facade has the most impact in reducing cooling load and amount of daylight within the building, whereas the impact of PVSD on the northern and western facades is negligible, and this study quantifies these impacts.  © 2023 IEEE.","","Cooling; Energy efficiency; Thermal energy; Building energy demands; Commercial building; Cooling load; Energy; Energy generations; Energy performance; Photovoltaic systems; Photovoltaics; Shading devices; Office buildings","","","","","","","Buildings - Analysis - IEA, (2023); Dubai Electricity & Water Authority (DEWA) | Annual Statistics, (2023); Timothy G., Global Energy Review 2021, pp. 1-36, (2021); Dubai Electricity & Water Authority | Shams Dubai DEWA, (2023); Kirimtat A., Tasgetiren M.F., Brida P., Krejcar O., Control of PV integrated shading devices in buildings: A review, Build Environ, 214, (2022); Peres A.C., Calili R., Louzada D., Impacts of photovoltaic shading devices on energy generation and cooling demand, Conference Record of the IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc., pp. 1186-1191, (2020); Baghoolizadeh M., Nadooshan A.A., Raisi A., Malekshah E.H., The effect of photovoltaic shading with ideal tilt angle on the energy cost optimization of a building model in European cities, Energy for Sustainable Development, 71, pp. 505-516, (2022); Jafari L., Salavatian S.M., Evaluation of photovoltaic performance integrated with shading system in optimizing building energy consumption in hot arid climates (Case study: An office building in Shiraz), Journal of Renewable and New Energy, 10, 1, pp. 70-85, (2023); Prototype Building Models | Building Energy Codes Program, (2023); Le Nguyen L.D., Et al., Facade integrated photovoltaic systems: Potential applications for commercial building in vietnam, Proceedings of 2019 International Conference on System Science and Engineering, ICSSE 2019, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc., pp. 219-223, (2019); Amoeda R., Amoeda R., Carneiro S., Daylighting simulation on restoration projects of vernacular architecture: An application of DIALux ® evo 9.1, Green Lines Bookseries on Heritage Studies, pp. 163-176, (2020); Dubai Building Code, pp. 1-843, (2021)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","1st Middle East and North Africa Solar Conference, MENA-SC 2023","15 November 2023 through 18 November 2023","Dubai","196124","","978-166549146-4","","","English","Middle East North Africa Sol.

Business and government investments in solar energy continue to rise every year since it is one of the most promising renewable technologies. Many of the most pressing issues with PV systems can be addressed with the help of artificial intelligence, including the determination of the PV modules' Max Power Point, the prediction of the energy generated by the system, the estimation of the parameters of the equivalent model of PV modules, and the detection of faults in the modules or cells. Despite having drawbacks like the large data requirements and lengthy calculation times associated with the training process, AI techniques outperform traditional methods. Efforts to investigate these issues and develop more effective solutions and methods continue today. By searching for topics linked to AI and PV systems in the most influential academic research databases, this article evaluates the most significant scientific works that use AI to solve the most pressing issues facing the PV industry. The significant of this research that it involves many verification methods starts from theoretical analysis through mathematical approaches and ends with simulation and emulation of the proposed method.

The objective of this work is to reduce TAT for the chemistry analyzer. The primary causes for delay and the causal relationships between all possible variables that affect the analyzing time process were identified. A model using system dynamic simulation for the process was built. A questionnaire was prepared to collect real values of the model variables; it covered 17 hospitals in Egypt and Sudan as samples of developing countries. The model key variables were: number of samples, staff number, number of devices, number of samples run at a time, and staff productivity. The system was tested by different scenarios using the collected real data. The results showed that TAT is directly proportional to the number of samples (an axiomatic result proves the success of the proposed model), and is inversely proportional to the rest of the key variables. The paper proposes a solution for reducing TAT through improving the staff productivity. When the productivity ranged between zero (unskilled new staff) and one (skilled new staff), TAT decreased from 299 minutes to 124 minutes on average respectively, which is nearly 41% reduction. This strategy is non costly since the lab skilled staff will train the new staff, a strategy that suites the low income countries. © 2014 IEEE.","chemistry analyzer; simulation model; system dynamics; TAT","Biomedical engineering; Developing countries; Productivity; System theory; Causal relationships; Low income countries; Model variables; Number of samples; Simulation model; System dynamic simulations; System Dynamics; System dynamics simulation; Laboratories","","","","","","","Hawkins R.C., Laboratory turnaround time, Clin Biochem Rev, 28, pp. 179-194, (2007); Howanitz J.H., Howanitz P.J., Laboratory results: Timeliness as a quality attribute and strategy, American Journal of Clinical Pathology, 116, pp. 311-315, (2001); Chung H.J., Lee W., Chun S., Park H.-H., Min W.-K., Analysis of turnaround time by subdividing three phases for outpatient chemistry specimens, Annals of Clinical & Laboratory Science, 39, 2, pp. 144-149, (2009); Goswami B., Singh B., Chawla R., Gupta V.K., Mallika V., Tum Around Time (T AT) as a Benchmark of Laboratory Performance, Indian Journal of Clinical Biochemistry, 25, 4, pp. 376-379, (2010); Breil B., Fritz F., Thiemann V., Dugas M., Mapping turnaround times (tat) to a generic timeline: A systematic review of tat definitions in clinical domains, BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making, 11, 34, (2011); Bilwani F., Siddiqui A., Vaqar S., Determination of delay in turnaround time (tat) of stat tests and its causes: An akuh experience, JPMA Journal of Pakistan Medical Association, 53, 2, pp. 65-67, (2003); Thomas J., Lanoue C., Reduction in Turnaround Time for Stat Specimen Within A Regional Health System Clinical Laboratory; Storrow A.B., Zhou C., Gaddis G., Han J.H., Miller K., Klubert D., Laidig A., Aronsk D., Decreasing lab turnaround time improves emergency department throughput and decreases emergency medical services diversion: A simulation model, Academic emergency medicine, 15, pp. 1130-1135, (2008); Wong H.J., Morra D., Wu R.C., Caesar M., Abrams H., Using system dynamics principles for conceptual modeling of publicly funded hospitals, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 63, pp. 79-88, (2012); Quinn T.D., Rudolph J.W., Fairchild D.G., Lab Turnaround Time and Delayed Discharges: A Systems-Based Action Research Investigation, (2005); Mekki S., Abdel Wahed M., Wahba K.M., A system dynamics based model for medical equipment maintenance procedure planning in developing countries, The 6'th Cairo International Biomedical Engineering Conference (CIBEC2012, (2012); Vensim Software","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","7th Cairo International Biomedical Engineering Conference, CIBEC 2014","11 December 2014 through 13 December 2014","Giza","110277","","978-147994412-5","","","English","Proc.

In this technique, the objective consists of minimizing the classical FCM function with a unity fuzzifier exponent plus the Kullback-Leibler (KL) information distance acting as a fuzzification and regularization term. The KL distance is proposed to measure the proximity between cluster membership function of a pixel and an average of the cluster membership functions of immediate neighborhood pixels. Therefore, minimizing this KL distance biases the cluster membership of the pixel toward this smoothed membership function of the local neighborhoods. This can provide immunity against noise and results in clustered images with piecewise homogeneous regions. Results of clustering and segmentation of synthetic and real-world medical images are presented to compare the performance of the proposed local membership KL information based FCM (LMKLFCM) and the standard FCM, a local data information based FCM (LDFCM) and a type of local membership information based FCM (LMFCM) algorithms. © 2014 IEEE.","data clustering; fuzzy c-means; KL divergence; local data and membership information; medical image segmentation","Biomedical engineering; Clustering algorithms; Fuzzy systems; Image segmentation; Medical image processing; Medical imaging; Pixels; Data clustering; Fuzzy C mean; Fuzzy c-means clustering algorithms; Homogeneous regions; Information distance; KL-divergence; Membership information; Regularization terms; Membership functions","","","","","","","Bdezek J.C., Pattern Recognition with Objective Fuzzy Algorithms, (1981); Bezdek J.C., Hall A.O., Clarke A.P., Review of mr image segmentation techniques using pattern recognition, Med.

The advancement in automatic retinal image analysis has made it possible to detect & diagnose this disease at an early stage. To indicate the presence and severity of Hypertensive Retinopathy, Arterio-Venous ratio (AVR) is an important measurement. For the calculation of AVR (the ratio of retinal arterioles to venuoles), classification of vessels into arteries and veins is an essential step. This paper proposes a novel technique for classifying the vessels into arteries and veins. The proposed system uses binary vessel mask and optic disc (OD) center localization to extract Region of Interest (ROI) around OD. Feature extraction modules extract a number of intensity based features followed by classification which classifies vessels as arteries and veins. The features are extracted by focusing on the visual difference between the arteries and veins in different color spaces. The proposed system is tested on a locally gather fundus image dataset. An accuracy of 81.3% is achieved. © 2014 IEEE.","Arterio-Venous Ratio (AVR); Hypertensive Retinopathy (HR); Optic Disc (OD); Region of Interest (ROI)","Biomedical engineering; Blood pressure; Eye protection; Ophthalmology; Arterio-Venous Ratio (AVR); High blood pressures; Hypertensive Retinopathy (HR); Novel techniques; Optic disc; Region of interest; Retinal image analysis; Visual differences; Image segmentation","","","","","","","Montgomery M., The Difference between Hypertensive Retinopathy and Diabetic Retinopathy""; Zamperini A., Giachetti A., Trucco E., Chin K.S., Effective features for artery-vein classification in digital fundus images, 25th IEEE International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS, (2012); Ruggeri A., Grisan E., De Luca M., An automatic system for the estimation of generalized arteriolar narrowing in retinal images, 29th Annual International Conference of the IEEE EMBS Citeinternationale, (2007); Muramatsu C., Hatanakab Y., Iwasea T., Haraa T., Fujitaa H., Automated detection and classification of major retinal vessels for determination of diameter ratio of arteries and veins, Medical Imaging 2010: Computer-Aided Diagnosis; Relan D., Macgillivray T., Ballerini L., Trucco E., Retinal vessel classification: Sorting arteries and veins, 35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE EMBS, (2013); Marco F.I., Enrico G., Alfredo R., Luminosity and contrast normalization in retinal images, Medical Image Analysis, 9, pp. 179-190, (2005); Tariq A., Akram M.U., An automated system for colored retinal image background and noise segmentation, IEEE Symposium on Industrial Electronics and Applications (ISIEA 2010, pp. 405-409, (2010); Akram M.U., Khan S.A., Multilayered thresholding-based blood vessel segmentation for screening of diabetic retinopathy, Engineering with Computers (EWCO, 29, 2, pp. 165-173, (2013); Ortiz D., Cubides M., Suarez A., Zequera M., Quiroga J., Gomez J., Arroyo N., Support system for the preventive diagnosis of hypertensive retinopathy, 32nd Annual International Conference of the IEEE EMBS, (2010); Akram M.U., Khan A., Iqbal K., Butt W.H., Retinal image: Optic dis localization and detection, Image Analysis and Recognition, Lecture Notes in Computer Science LNCS 6112, pp. 40-49, (2010); Gonzales R.C., Woods R.E., Digital Image Processing; LSSVM MATLAB Library","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","7th Cairo International Biomedical Engineering Conference, CIBEC 2014","11 December 2014 through 13 December 2014","Giza","110277","","978-147994412-5","","","English","Proc.

Initially identify the maximum power peak to track Global Maximum Power Point (GMPP) in partial shading conditions. To reduce the time of identifying the global peak, the new global peak detection based on the PV curve triangle is proposed. The PV curve triangle is formed by the voltage axis and initial and final straight lines in the P-V characteristics. The altitude drawn to the base of the triangle gives the global peak location that, the four peaks' ranges near the altitude that two peaks back and two peaks ahead. This method requires only four scanning irrespective of the number of modules in the PV array. The method is examined with 8 case studies of different partial shading conditions on 5×1, 9×1, and 9×4 arrays.

Dept., Faculty of Science, Suez Canal University, Ismailia, Egypt","X-ray C-arm is an important imaging tool in interventional surgery, road-mapping and radiation therapy. It provides accurate description of vascular anatomy and therapy end point. The C-arm scanner produces two-dimensional (2D) x-ray projection data obtained with flat-panel detector by rotating the source around the patient. The number of 2D projections acquired is several hundreds, which results in significant amount of radiation dose. Unlike the conventional fluoroscopic imaging, three-dimensional (3D) C-arm computed tomography (CT) provides more accurate cross-sectional images which are valuable for therapy planning, guidance and evaluation in interventional radiology. However, 3D vascular imaging using the conventional C-arm fluoroscopy is a challenging task. First, the rotation orbit of the C-arm gantry is usually limited to a range less than those of CT scanners. Second, in several commercial models (including the one of consideration in this study), the x-ray source and detector are shifted from the gantry isocenter to enlarge the scanner field-of-view (FOV), which is so-called the offset scan. Finally, it is difficult to acquire sufficient projection views required for stable 3D reconstruction using manually controlled gantry motion. Inspired by the theory of compressed sensing, we developed an image reconstruction algorithm for the conventional angiography C-arm scanners. The main challenge in this image reconstruction problem is the projection data limitations. We consider a small number of views (less than 10 views) acquired from a short orbit with the offset scan geometry. The proposed method is developed using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and results obtained from simulated data and real data are encouraging. The proposed method can significantly contribute to the reduction of patient dose and provides a framework to generate 3D vascular images using the conventional C-arm scanners. © 2014 IEEE.","3D C-arm CT; ADMM; computed tomography; Image reconstruction","Biomedical engineering; Compressed sensing; Image reconstruction; Robotic arms; Scanning; X ray detectors; X rays; ADMM; Alternating direction method of multipliers; Cross sectional image; Image reconstruction algorithm; Interventional radiology; Reconstruction problems; Three-dimensional image reconstruction; Two Dimensional (2 D); Computerized tomography","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (24601004)","","Strobel N., Et al., 3D Imaging with Flat-Detector C-Arm Systems, pp. 33-51, (2009); Kaufinan A.A., Vascular and Interventional Radiology, (2004); Li M., Yang H., Kudo H., An accurate iterative reconstruction algorithm for sparse objects: Application to 3d blood-vessel reconstruction from limited number of projections, Phys.

This paper presents a novel computerized method to automatically detect mass lesions (i.e. detect suspicious locations containing abnormalities inside the breast area) on digitized mammogram images. In particular, we implement an enhanced version of the region growing algorithm for segmentation of mass lesions that can be implemented in a complete CAD system. The proposed algorithm uses region growing technique with a novel automatic threshold estimation method to detect and segment mass lesions. The proposed algorithm detects masses by analyzing a single view of the breast (i. e. Medio-Lateral oblique (MLO) view or Cranio-Caudal (CC) view). The performance of the proposed algorithm was evaluated using two mammogram databases from two different hospitals. The matching percentage of the segmented regions obtained by the proposed algorithm is 83% with respect to the ground truth (i.e. reference determined by an expert radiologist).

The purpose of this research is to study the effect of S-shape thickness and the type of material on the stiffness of a modified Niagara foot design on the toe and the heel modes of loading. In this study, numerical tests using finite element (FE) method were conducted on four shape models with three different materials. These models are developed by changing the thickness of the upper part of the S-shape 'B'. Results indicated that the increase of 'B' had increased the stiffness of the foot at the heel mode of loading. Corresponding results were also obtained at only the early stage of the toe loading. Such effect was diminished at the later stages of toe loading due to the closing of the gap between the prongs and the arch. The stiffness characteristics and the force-displacement profiles were consistent with the different design features, indicating that the FE testing protocol is able to capture the mechanical behavior of such designs and can be used to validate the preliminary designs before manufacture.

Unfortunately, sensitivity to noise corruption exposes automatic auscultation to misdiagnosis risks since original pathological features are vulnerable to miscellaneous HS noise. Therefore, HS denoising is pivotal to obtain qualified HS signal for further analysis and precise diagnosis. Traditional wavelet shrinkage (TWS) method achieves good performance on eliminating Gaussian distributed noise, yet it is powerless against randomly distributed environmental noise. To tackle such a bottleneck problem, an environmental HS noise elimination method based on singular spectrum analysis (SSA) is proposed in this paper. With the aid of singular value decomposition (SVD), effective eigenvalues related to the principle components (PC) of pure HS signal are selected to reconstruct HS signal while eliminating environmental noise efficiently. Validated using both normal and pathological HS signals with diversified environmental noises, the proposed method exhibits better denoising performance than TWS in most cases. As such, this work provides an attractive alternative for HS environmental HS noise denoising. © 2014 IEEE.","denoising; eigenvalue; environmental noise; heart sound; singular spectrum analysis","Acoustic noise; Biomedical engineering; Biomedical signal processing; Cardiology; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Signal reconstruction; Singular value decomposition; Spectrum analysis; De-noising; Eigen-value; Environmental noise; Heart sounds; Singular spectrum analysis; Gaussian noise (electronic)","","","","","Science and Technology Development Fund, (016/2012/Al)","","Chauhan S., Wang P., Sing Lim C., Anantharaman V., A computer-aided mfcc-based hmm system for automatic auscultation, Computers in Biology and Medicine, 38, pp. 221-233, (2008); Varady P., Wavelet-based adaptive denoising of phonocardiographic records, Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE, 2, pp. 1846-1849, (2001); Donoho D.L., Johnstone I.M., Kerkyacharian G., Picard D., Wavelet shrinkage: Asymptopia?, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

Brain waves were recorded using Neurosky Mindwave headset from 25 volunteers. Two approaches are adopted for the pre-processing stage; the first approach uses empirical mode decomposition to isolate electro-oculogram signal from brain waves, then, extracts eye blinking signal. The second approach extracts eye blinking signal directly from brain waves. Features are extracted based on time delineation of the eye blinking waveform and classified using linear discriminant analysis. The best correct identification and equal error rates achieved are 98.51% and 2.5% for identification and verification modes respectively. The obtained results in this paper confirm that eye blinking waveform carries discriminant information and is therefore appropriate as a basis for human recognition task. © 2014 IEEE.","Biometric authentication; Brain waves; Discriminant analysis; Electro-oculogram; Empirical mode decomposition; Eye blinking; Time delineation","Authentication; Biomedical engineering; Biometrics; Discriminant analysis; Biometric authentication; Brain wave; Electro-oculogram; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Eye-blinking; Time delineation; Biomedical signal processing","","","","","","","Singh Y.N., Singh S.K., Ray A.K., Bioelectrical signals as emerging biometrics: Issues and challenges, ISRN Signal Processing, (2012); Abo-Zahhad M., Ahmed S.M., Abbas S., Biometric authentication based on pcg and ecg signals: Present status and future directions, Signal, Image and Video Processing, 8, 4, pp. 739-751, (2014); Matsumoto T., Matsumoto H., Yamada K., Hoshino S., Impact of artificial gummy fingers on fingerprint systems, Electronic Imaging 2002.

By 2050, the UAE aims to generate 50% of electric energy from carbon-free sources such as solar photovoltaic (PV). PV panel system's maximum output power varies over time, depending on external elements such as the sun's radiation, the surrounding temperature, dust, wind, etc., which is highly associated with the panel positioning. As of now, there is no well-defined methodology for determining the optimal distribution and positioning of large-scale solar panels to maximize energy output. To tackle this issue, our research investigates the impact of solar panel positioning and distribution on energy efficiency using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). GA is an optimization technique inspired by the principles of natural selection and genetics, known for its effectiveness in solving intricate problems across various domains. We anticipate that this study will contribute to the optimization of distribution and positioning in large-scale solar power plants, ultimately enhancing their performance.  © 2023 IEEE.","Genetic Algorithm; PV system; Renewable energy; Solar Panel positioning","Electric power distribution; Energy efficiency; Solar concentrators; Solar energy; Solar panels; Solar power generation; Solar power plants; Carbon-free; Electric energies; Large-scales; Optimisations; Photovoltaic systems; Renewable energies; Solar panel positioning; Solar panels; Solar photovoltaics; Solar Power Systems; Genetic algorithms","","","","","","","Key World Energy Statistics 2020, (2020); Majumdar S., Paris C.M., Environmental impact of urbanization, bank credits, and energy use in the uae-A tourism-induced ekc model, Sustainability, 14, 13, (2022); Ahmed B.M., Alhialy N.F.F., Optimum efficiency of pv panel using genetic algorithms to touch proximate zero energy house (nzeh), Civil Engineering Journal, 5, 8, pp. 1832-1840, (2019); Zhang Y., Zhang Z., Ma J., A rolling bearing fault diagnosis method based on VMD - multiscale fractal dimension/energy and optimized support vector machine, Measurement, 93, pp. 143-152, (2016); Knorig R.W., Cohen J., Fritzing: A tool for advancing electronic prototyping for designers, Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Tangible and Embedded Interaction, pp. 351-358, (2009); Philip P.C., Subaihi F., Musgun S., Ghebretatios S., Alnajjar F., Solar car parking for maximum power utilization at the united arab emirates university: Case study, The International Conference on Innovations in Computing Research, pp. 454-464, (2022)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","1st Middle East and North Africa Solar Conference, MENA-SC 2023","15 November 2023 through 18 November 2023","Dubai","196124","","978-166549146-4","","","English","Middle East North Africa Sol.

The split source inverters offer both input voltage boosting and DC/AC conversion capabilities with a single power stage. Therefore, the DC side voltage and output current need to be controlled for the proper operation of the SSI. Furthermore, MPPT is essential for grid-connected PV inverters to extract maximum power from the solar. To achieve these objectives, the Perturb and Observe MPPT (PO-MPPT) algorithm generates the input current reference of the SSI. The proposed MPC approach is responsible for controlling the input and output currents of the SSI. The effectiveness of the proposed control approach is investigated by simulation studies performed on MATLAB/Simulink environment. The results reveal that the proposed approach successfully regulates the DC side voltage and output current with the MPPT capability.

Initial stability at placement and the development of osseointegration in the following healing process are two important factors for implant success. The purpose of this study was to prove the primary stability of the implant and abutment angulation and its reliability upon the micromotion level and stress-distribution pattern around the neck of the implant by means of Osstell and comparing these results with a finite element model results. Nine complete edentulous patients were included in the study, where the primary stability was measured using (Osstell) and the results were compared with the computer model results. It was observed that no difference and no change between the right and left sides, where both were stable in bucco-lingual and mesio-distal measurements. And also the mean values for right and left sides at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months were nearly stable at all stages in bucco-lingual and mesio-distal measurements.

While existing studies focus on determining optimal cleaning frequencies for individual PV systems, route planning becomes vital for large-scale PV fleet cleaning in real-world scenarios. This study investigates a PV fleet with three systems to identify the best cleaning schedule, considering operational costs associated with cleaning and transportation. By analyzing these factors, the study determines the timing and frequency of cleanings that maximize profitability and provides recommendations for optimal cleaning routes. The study highlights the inefficiency of standardized cleaning schedules for PV fleets due to unique system characteristics and operational requirements, necessitating varying cleaning frequencies. To improve accuracy and effectiveness, future research should integrate forecasting techniques considering electricity demand dynamics and dust accumulation seasonality.  © 2023 IEEE.","","Fleet operations; Profitability; Cleaning frequencies; Cleaning schedules; Energy output; Large-scales; Photovoltaics; PV system; Real-world scenario; Route planning; System characteristics; System energy; Cleaning","","","","","","","Ilse K., Et al., Techno-economic assessment of soiling losses and mitigation strategies for solar power generation, Joule, 3, 10, pp. 2303-2321, (2019); Micheli L., Fernandez E.F., Muller M., Almonacid F., Extracting and generating pv soiling profiles for analysis, forecasting, and cleaning optimization, IEEE J.

Specifically, we address two challenges: transmission efficiency of the transmitting antennas, and the absorption efficiency of the receiving antennas.  © 2023 IEEE.","","Earth (planet); Energy transfer; Inductive power transmission; Receiving antennas; Solar panels; Absorption efficiency; Harvesting energies; Solar panels; Space-based; Technologies and applications; Transmission efficiency; Transmitting antenna; Wireless energy transfers; Solar energy","","","","","","","Tesla N., The transmission of electric energy without wires, The thir-teenth Anniversary Number of the Electrical World and Engineer, (1904); Glaser P.E., Power from the Sun: Its future, Science, 162, pp. 857-886, (1968); Almoneef T., Ramahi O.M., Metamaterial electromagnetic energy harvester with near unity efficiency, Applied Physics Letters, 106, pp. 153902-153904, (2015); Ashoor A.Z., Almoneef T.S., Ramahi O.M., A planar dipole array surface for electromagnetic energy harvesting and wireless power transfer, IEEE Transaction on Microwave Theory and Techniques, 66, 3, pp. 1553-1560, (2018); Almoneef T.S., Erkmen F., Alotaibi M.A., Ramahi O.M., A new approach to microwave rectennas using tightly coupled antennas, IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation, 66, 4, pp. 1714-1724, (2018); Smith T.D.R., Pendry J.B., Wiltshire M.C.K., Metamaterials and negative refractive index, Science, 305, 5685, pp. 788-792, (2004)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","1st Middle East and North Africa Solar Conference, MENA-SC 2023","15 November 2023 through 18 November 2023","Dubai","196124","","978-166549146-4","","","English","Middle East North Africa Sol.

Instead of the commonly used monochromator light source, our setup uses 30 high-brightness LEDs as a tunable quasi-monochromatic light source covering the wavelength range of 290 - 1300 nm. Halogen lamps are used to generate bifacial bias-lighting conditions resembling the spectrum of AM1.5G. The setup has been fully characterized for spectral irradiances and spatial uniformities of all light sources. Validation measurements carried out using a reference cell of 2×2 cm2 area from Fraunhofer ISE demonstrated an agreement better than 2% over the wavelength range of 425 - 940 nm, with an expanded uncertainty of 2.6%. In the UV and IR regions, the discrepancies are higher but still within estimated uncertainties. The setup is being employed as a reference in an interlaboratory comparison of indoor solar cells based on emerging technologies. A reference cell, an Epishine organic indoor cell, and a Panasonic amorphous silicon indoor cell are distributed among participants and measured for various parameters including short circuit current. We tested a method for deriving the reference values for short circuit currents mathematically from the differential spectral responsivities of the cells. The preliminary results shown indicate that the developed setup is feasible for measurements and calibrations of indoor solar cells.  © 2023 IEEE.","","Amorphous silicon; Light emitting diodes; Monochromators; Short circuit currents; Uncertainty analysis; Halogen lamps; High brightness leds (HB-LED); Light conditions; Lighting conditions; Quasi-monochromatic; Short-circuit currents; Spectral responsivity; Tunables; Uncertainty; Wavelength ranges; Solar cells","","","","","European Union s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; European Metrology Programme for Innovation and Research, EMPIR; Academy of Finland, AKA, (320167)","Funding text 1: The results reported in this paper are derived from activities within the frame of the EMPIR project 19ENG01 Metro-PV (Metrology for emerging PV applications) that has received funding from the EMPIR program co-financed by the Participating States and the European Union s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program.

The sputtering process the Mo films was carried out at different working gas (Ar) pressure of 0.6, 2.0, 5.0, 8.0, and 12.0 mTorr using direct-current (DC) planar magnetron and at fixed sputtering power density. Whereas, the co-evaporation process of all CIGS thin films was carried out at fixed conditions of deposition rates and substrate temperature. The variation in Mo sputtering pressure is intended in this research work to influence the amount of Na out-diffused from SLG substrate to CIGS film during the growth process. High-resolution field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was used to examine the morphology of both the Mo-coated SLG and the as-deposited CIGS thin films. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to examine the film microstructure such as preferred grain orientation in Mo and CIGS films and residual intrinsic stress in the Mo films. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was applied to measure the root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness of the CIGS thin films. Also, Na out-diffusion through as-sputtered Mo and as-deposited CIGS thin films was depth profiled using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). Furthermore, the performance of the CIGS complete devices was evaluated under standard conditions of 1000 W/m2 and 25°C.  © 2023 IEEE.","","Deposition rates; Evaporation; Field emission microscopes; Glass substrates; Magnetrons; Metal substrates; Morphology; Physical vapor deposition; Secondary ion mass spectrometry; Sputtering; Surface roughness; Thin films; Working pressure; Back contact; CIGS films; CIGS thin films; Co-evaporations; Device performance; Evaporation process; Micro-structural properties; Molybdenum films; Soda lime glass substrate; Sputtering process; Scanning electron microscopy","","","","","","","Dullweber T., Hanna G., Shams-Kolahi W., Schwartzlander A., Contreras M.A., Noufi R., Schock H.W., Thin Solid Films 361-362, pp. 478-481, (2000); Bube R.H., Photovoltaic Materials, (1998); Tuttle J.R., Contreras M., Tennant A., Albin D., Noufi R., Proceedings of the 23rd ieee photovoltaic specialists conference, Louisville, KY, (1993); Gabor A.M., Tuttle J.R., Albin D.S., Matson R., Franz A., Niles D.W., Contreras M.A., Hermann A.M., Noufi R., Mat.

The potential balancing area for grid integration strategies is for the conventional electricity grid at a regional or national level. The focus is on integrating significant amounts of solar energy into the overall energy portfolio of a specific region or country. The research addresses the issues of energy transition and the requirement for solutions to integration problems. The goal of the research was to determine which resource management tactics were most advantageous. The approach included examining new grid integration technologies, assessing the efficacy of the current laws and regulations, and observing how solar resources management affected the potential of PV installations. The research utilized the literature review approach to analyze and synthesize relevant research articles, reports, and policy documents. It included interdisciplinary studies that explored the synergies between various PV systems and solar resources, energy storage, advance transmission concepts, demand management systems and solar-to-fuel and other high-embodied energy products. The research discovered the several concepts, technologies and policies that could enable the integration of 100% renewable electricity. These included energy storage, demand response, smart grid technologies, and policies that encourage the use of renewable energy sources. In addition, the significance of managing solar resources in maximizing the potential of PV systems was noted in the research. The research's key findings are that using the suggested technologies, concepts, and policies will make integrating 100% of renewable power possible. The paper advises the execution of a thorough strategy for resource management, which combines a number of the identified tactics and is adapted to the unique traits and difficulties of the various areas. The study acknowledges the limitation of the review, such as the lack of empirical data and the limited scope of the analyzed studies. Further research is recommended to investigate the economic, social, and environmental impacts of the identified strategies and their scalability of different regions.  © 2023 IEEE.","","Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission; Electric power transmission networks; Fuel storage; Laws and legislation; Resource allocation; Smart power grids; Solar energy; Electricity grids; Grid integration; Integration strategy; Photovoltaic systems; Photovoltaics; Regional levels; Renewable electricity; Renewable energies; Resource management; Solar resources; Environmental impact","","","","","","","International Energy Programme, (2022); Vinod R.K., Singh S.K., Solar photovoltaic modeling and simulation: As a renewable energy solution, Energy Reports, 4, pp. 701-712, (2018); Aninnah P.K., Folly K., Voltage rise issue with high penetration of grid connected pv, IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy, in 19th world congress, International Federation of Automatic control, (2014); Karimi M., Naidu K., Uddin S., Et al., Photovoltaic penetration issues and impacts in distribution network- A review, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 53, pp. 594-605, (2016); Appen J.V., Braun M., Stetz T., Diwold K., Geibel D., Time in the sun: The challenge of high pv penetration in the german electric grid, IEEE power & energy magazine, pp. 55-64, (2013); Mitali J., Dhinakaran S., Mohamad A.A., Energy storage systems: A review, Energy Storage and Saving, 1, 3, pp. 166-216, (2022); Clack C.T.M., Qvist S.A., Apt J., Et al., Evaluation of proposal for reliable low-cost grid power with 100% wind, water, and solar, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 114, 26, pp. 6722-6727, (2017); Dzikiy P., 100% renewable energy across all sectors possible by 2050 with solar leading the way, study says""; Shaffer W., Guetan L., Reuter A., Et al., The role of smart grid in integrating renewable energy, National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), (2015); Jackson J., Smart grids: An optimised electric power system, Future Energy, pp. 631-651, (2014); Rekioua D., Energy storage systems for photovoltaic and wind systems: A review, Energies, 16, 2, (2023); DEWA inaugurates pilot project at the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park using Tesla's lithium-ion energy storage solution, (2023); Yang S., Lei H., Liu Z., Modeling and simulation of solar photovoltaic (PV) system, Toward Better Photovoltaic Systems: Design, Simulation, Optimization, Analysis, and Operations, pp. 101-128, (2023); Hossain M.J., Mahmud M.A., Renewable energy integration challenges and solutions, Green Energy and Technology, Dec, (2013); Photovoltaics Report, (2021); Younus A.M., Zaidan M.N., Renewable energy and management systems' roles in the development of energy management methods: Business and technology policies, British Journal of Global Ecology and Sustainable Development, 4, (2022); Hasan N.S., Masgar M.S., Ahmad S., City-integrated renewable energy for urban sustainability, Science, 352, 6288, (2016)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","1st Middle East and North Africa Solar Conference, MENA-SC 2023","15 November 2023 through 18 November 2023","Dubai","196124","","978-166549146-4","","","English","Middle East North Africa Sol.

The applications considered include domestic water heating, solar cooking, hydrogen production, plastic recycling and space cooling. Technical feasibility is evaluated, including factors such as site suitability, resource availability, and engineering requirements. The regulatory environment and policy framework in the UK with respect to renewable energy is also assessed to determine how Concentrating Solar can fit within this context[2]. Our findings suggests that the UK has moderate potential for concentrating solar applications, with low concentrating photovoltaics (LCPV) having the highest prospects. The best locations for these technologies are all situated in the southern parts of the UK. Potential barriers and challenges to the adoption of concentrated solar in the UK, such as space requirements, lack of awareness, and public acceptance are identified, and recommendations for addressing these issues are provided.  © 2023 IEEE.","","Solar power generation; Water recycling; Concentrated solar; Concentrating solar; Domestic water heating; Medium-scale; Plastics recycling; Small scale; Solar cooking; Solar technology; Space cooling; Sustainable energy solutions; Hydrogen production","","","","","","","Abu-Bakar S.H., Muhammad-Sukki F., Freier D., Ramirez I.R., Mallick T.K., Munir A.B., Yasin S.H.M., Mas'ud A.A., Bani N.A., Performance analysis of a novel rotationally asymmetrical compound parabolic concentrator for concentrating photovoltaic applications, Energy, 134, pp. 649-661, (2017); Andre P., Aste N., Basosi R., Berta G., Bodda E., Di Nicola G., Galatioto A., Gentili E., Lenzi G., Pierangioli L., Rossi F., A roadmap for the integration of renewables in industrial parks, Renewable Energy, 152, pp. 370-384, (2020); Fahrenbruch A.L., Bube R.H., Fundamentals of Solar Cells., (1983); Tosun O., Yesilkanat C.M., The analysis of the monthly solar radiation characteristics for the eastern Mediterranean region of Turkey, Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy, 11, 2, (2019)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","1st Middle East and North Africa Solar Conference, MENA-SC 2023","15 November 2023 through 18 November 2023","Dubai","196124","","978-166549146-4","","","English","Middle East North Africa Sol.

To make full use of both technologies, it is necessary to integrate them and connect them to Hospital Information Systems. We propose a framework for integration of Model-guided Therapy in Hospital Information Systems based on the Electronic Medical Record, and a task-based Workflow Management System, which is suitable for clinical end users. Two prototypes - one based on Business Process Modeling Language, one based on the scrum-board - are presented. From the experience with these prototypes, we developed a novel personalized visualization system for Surgical Workflows and Model-guided Therapy.

The research objectives are to determine the energy yields and power generation of the BIPV system installed to each façade orientation and evaluate the losses due to increasing modules' temperature and the electric power gains from simulating different cooling levels for the BIPV systems. The reasoning of this analysis is due to the difference in the direct and diffused irradiance levels for each orientation at different times of the day, seasonal changes, as well as the different incidence angles and sun path. The different times each orientation receives the solar irradiance combined with the ambient temperature, wind speed, and other meteorological conditions significantly affect the power output and the modules' temperatures. The results assessed the arrays' temperature, power yields, and cooling effectiveness in the power gains for each façade orientation. Each orientation has its unique thermal behavior, which is important for identifying the cooling requirements compared with the potential gains. The average total gain of (13.86 %) was achieved by simulating cooling, with the South/West (17.7 %) at the highest gains, followed by South/East (17.3 %), and last is the North (3.9%). In three months, the North orientation and sub-orientations achieved higher power generation than the South. The South/East and South/West have higher power yields than the South. Cooling management of BIPV in summer is much more applicable than in winter; this will be described in the findings of this study.  © 2023 IEEE.","and Temperature losses in BIPV; BIPV; Cooling of BIPV; Desert climate; Energy yield; Module temperature; Vertical Façade","Electric losses; Tall buildings; Wind; And temperature loss in BIPV; BIPV; Cooling effectiveness; Cooling of BIPV; Desert climates; Energy yields; Module temperature; Power; Temperature loss; Vertical facade; Cooling systems","","","","","","","Casini M., A positive energy building for the middle east climate: Restart4smart solar house at solar decathlon middle east 2018, Renew Energy, 159, pp. 1269-1296, (2020); Noaman D.S., Moneer S.A., Megahed N.A., Sherihan A.E.-G., Integration of active solar cooling technology into passively designed facade in hot climates, Journal of Building Engineering, (2022); Elnosh A., Et al., Field study of factors influencing performance of PV modules in buildings (BIPV/BAPV) installed in UAE, 2018 IEEE 7th World Conference on Photovoltaic Energy Conversion (WCPEC) (A Joint Conference of 45th IEEE PVSC, 28th PVSEC & 34th EU PVSEC), IEEE, pp. 565-568, (2018); Davis M.W., Fanney A.H., Dougherty B.P., Prediction of building integrated photovoltaic cell temperatures, Journal of Solar Energy Engineering, Transactions of the ASME, 123, 3, pp. 200-210, (2001); Wei C.G., Pan R.N., Wang D., Research of nominal operating temperature testing method of BIPV module, Key Engineering Materials, pp. 18-22, (2017); Amelia A.R., Irwan Y.M., Leow W.Z., Irwanto M., Safwati I., Zhafarina M., Investigation of the effect temperature on photovoltaic (PV) panel output performance, J Adv Sci Eng Inf Technol, 6, 5, pp. 682-688, (2016); Aelenei L., Pereira R., Goncalves H., Athienitis A., Thermal performance of a hybrid BIPVPCM: Modeling, design and experimental investigation, Energy Procedia, pp. 474-483, (2014); Deschamps E.M., Ruther R., Optimization of inverter loading ratio for grid connected photovoltaic systems, Solar Energy, 179, pp. 106-118, (2019)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","1st Middle East and North Africa Solar Conference, MENA-SC 2023","15 November 2023 through 18 November 2023","Dubai","196124","","978-166549146-4","","","English","Middle East North Africa Sol.

A sensor surface based on a carboxy-terminated oligo ethylene-glycol (OEG) self-assembled monolayer (SAM) was developed and fully characterised. Optimal conditions for antibody immobilisation were found for a buffer pH approximately one unit below the pI of the antibody, which yielded both higher antibody density on the sensor surface as well as higher sensor response to the antigen. At the same time the surface showed good resistance to non-specific adsorption of high concentrations of proteins. A non-faradaic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy biosensor to detect human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in full serum was demonstrated as a proof of concept. By using the phase of the impedance at 100 mHz as the sensor response, a linear relationship of the phase shift vs the logarithm of hCG concentration was established between 26 fM and 0.26 nM with a sensitivity of 0.6 degree per decade, which is a significant improvement over current state-of-the-art biosensor systems. © 2014 IEEE.","Biosensors; hCG; Impedance Spectroscopy; Label-free","Antibodies; Biomedical engineering; Biosensors; Ethylene; Ethylene glycol; Self assembled monolayers; Spectroscopy; Bio-sensor platforms; Clinical diagnostics; Electrochemical biosensor; Human chorionic gonadotropins; Impedance spectroscopy; Label free; Nonspecific adsorption; Point of care diagnostic; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy","","","","","","","D'Orazio P., Biosensors in clinical chemistry, Clin.

The temperature and irradiance dependance of each of these STC parameters is then calculated using a set of translation equations. Although the translation equations are based on device physics, the biggest disadvantage of this approach is that the constants in the translation equations are not universal for different photovoltaic technologies. To address this limitation, a unified fitting approach has been proposed, which not only extracts the five photovoltaic parameters but also adjusts the constants of the translation equations. The proposed method exhibits a marked improvement in the fitting accuracy for the measured I-V curves of the module.  © 2023 IEEE.","Electrical model; I-V curves; One-diode model; Parameters fitting; Photovoltaic; Translation equations","Diodes; Solar panels; Diode modeling; Electrical modeling; I - V curve; One-diode model; Parameter fitting; Photovoltaic parameters; Photovoltaics; Standard tests; Test condition; Translation equations; Curve fitting","","","","","","","Aly S.P., Ahzi S., Barth N., Effect of physical and environmental factors on the performance of a photovoltaic panel, Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells., 200, (2019); Alam M.A., Khan M.R., Principles of solar cells : Connecting perspectives on device, system, reliability, and data science, (2022); Naeijian M., Rahimnejad A., Ebrahimi S.M., Pourmousa N., Gadsden S.A., Parameter estimation of pv solar cells and modules using whippy harris hawks optimization algorithm, Energy Reports., 7, pp. 4047-4063, (2021); Chavali R.V.K., De Wolf S., Alam M.A., Device physics underlying silicon heterojunction and passivating-contact solar cells: A topical review, Progress in Photovoltaics: Research and Applications., 26, pp. 241-260, (2018); Aly S.P., Ahzi S., Barth N., An adaptive modelling technique for parameters extraction of photovoltaic devices under varying sunlight and temperature conditions, Applied Energy., 236, (2019); Di Piazza M.C., Luna M., Petrone G., Spagnuolo G., Translation of the single-diode pv model parameters identified by using explicit formulas, IEEE Journal of Photovoltaic., 7, pp. 1009-1016, (2017); Siddiqui M.U., Arif A.F.M., Bilton A.M., Dubowsky S., Elshafei M., An improved electric circuit model for photovoltaic modules based on sensitivity analysis, Solar Energy., 90, pp. 29-42, (2013); Siddiqui M.U., Abido M., Parameter estimation for five- and sevenparameter photovoltaic electrical models using evolutionary algorithms, Applied Soft Computing., 13, 12, pp. 4608-4621, (2013); De Soto W., Klein S.A., Beckman W.A., Improvement and validation of a model for photovoltaic array performance, Solar Energy., 80, pp. 78-88, (2006); Chavali R.V.K., Wilcox J.R., Ray B., Gray J.L., Alam M.A., Correlated nonideal effects of dark and light I-V characteristics in a-Si/c-Si heterojunction solar cells, IEEE J Photovolt., 4, pp. 763-771, (2014); Sun X., Asadpour R., Nie W., Mohite A.D., Alam M.A., A physics-based analytical model for perovskite solar cells, IEEE J Photovolt., 5, pp. 1389-1394, (2015); Sun X., Chavali R.V.K., Alam M.A., Real-time monitoring and diagnosis of photovoltaic system degradation only using maximum power point-The Suns-Vmp method, Progress in Photovoltaics: Research and Applications., 27, pp. 55-66, (2019); Aly S.P., John J.J., Mathiak G., Albadwawi O., Pomares L., Alberts V., A thermal model for bifacial PV panels, 2022 IEEE 49th Photovoltaics Specialists Conference (PVSC), IEEE, pp. 457-459, (2022); Aly S.P., Ahzi S., Barth N., Figgis B.W., Two-dimensional finite difference-based model for coupled irradiation and heat transfer in photovoltaic modules, Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells., 180, pp. 289-302, (2018); Aly S.P., Ahzi S., Barth N., Abdallah A., Using energy balance method to study the thermal behavior of PV panels under time-varying field conditions, Energy Conversion Management., 175, pp. 246-262, (2018)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","1st Middle East and North Africa Solar Conference, MENA-SC 2023","15 November 2023 through 18 November 2023","Dubai","196124","","978-166549146-4","","","English","Middle East North Africa Sol.

However, such feature is not used in many critical care units and/or laboratories either due to limited capabilities and access offered by manufacturers of such equipment or because of high cost for interface software packages especially for developing countries. The negative impact is more felt in laboratories with old instruments lacking remote connection ports but having an embedded maintenance and/or troubleshooting software. This paper describes a direct access remote diagnosis and troubleshooting for the input and output devices of a critical care and laboratory instrument using a flat data cable, an 8 cm × 10 cm built-in printed circuit board designed for this purpose, a standard parallel cable, and a control software. The main advantage of this approach is its low cost, compact design and simple implementation besides being convenient and suitable for other instruments possessing input/output devices with the same specifications. Implementation of the software and hardware related to accessing the instrument's membrane keypad and display using a PC has been successfully accomplished and tested leading to the use of all PC communication capabilities including remote connection and access. By integrating all hardware components, the prototype system was capable of remotely diagnosing and controlling the instrument on real-time basis. © 2014 IEEE.","Critical care instruments; direct remote access; laboratory equipment; remote diagnosis; troubleshooting","Biomedical engineering; Cables; Developing countries; Diagnosis; Intensive care units; Printed circuit boards; Software testing; Communication capabilities; Critical care; Critical care units; Input/output devices; Laboratory equipments; Remote access; Remote diagnosis; Software and hardwares; Laboratories","","","","","","","Singh Bhatia J., Et al., Director Center for Development of Advanced Computing, (2006); Improving readiness for army medical equipment using remote diagnosis access, The United States Army Medical Material Agency USAMMA, (2009); Sanchez C.R., Et al., Industrial telemaintenance: Remote management experience from subway to industrial electronics, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, 50, 3; Laugier A., Allahwerdi N., Baudin J., Gaffney P., Grimson W., Groth T., Schilders L., Remote instrument telemaintenance, Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine, 50, pp. 187-194, (1996); Report 05091 Survey of Fourteen Blood Gas Analyzers, (2006); Mridha M., Ask P., Oberg P., Clinical engineering challenges and problems with medical instrumentation in bangladesh, Journal of Clinical Engineering, 13, (1988); CD74HCT4514 4-Line to 16-Line Decoders/Demultiplexers with Input Latches Data Sheet, (2004); TLP521GB High Density Mounting Phototransistor Optically Coupled Isolator Data Sheet, (2003); Interfacing the Standard Parallel Port; CE Marking for Medical Devices; Johnson J.A., Specialist in biomedical policy, FDA Regulation of Medical Devices, 25, (2012); Grimes S.L., The future of clinical engineering: The challenge of change, Clinical Engineering Handbook, (2003)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","7th Cairo International Biomedical Engineering Conference, CIBEC 2014","11 December 2014 through 13 December 2014","Giza","110277","","978-147994412-5","","","English","Proc.

The droop control mechanism efficiently manages the microgrid's output power by monitoring and controlling its frequency and voltage. Unlike the conventional droop control method, the proposed control approach acknowledges the deviations in frequency and voltage during steady-state operation. In response to these deviations, the suggested controller takes action autonomously, without relying on communication lines, to restore the system to its nominal frequency and voltage levels. The proposed approach's efficacy is verified by executing a comprehensive simulation using MATLAB/Simulink. Two distinct scenarios are explored: one involving a step change in load for different droop gains and the other a variation in solar insolation levels. The simulation results are compared with a conventional droop to see the efficacy of the proposed approach. The proposed controller's superiority is demonstrated by its adeptness in restoring frequency and voltage while ensuring equitable power sharing among DGs for different droop coefficients.  © 2023 IEEE.","droop controller; Photovoltaic; secondary controller; Washoutfilter","Electric loads; MATLAB; Microgrids; Solar power generation; Control mechanism; Droop control; Droop controllers; Filter-based; Microgrid; Output power; Photovoltaics; Secondary controller; Washout Filters; Washoutfilter; Controllers","","","","","","","Jiang J., Peyghami S., Coates C., Blaabjerg F., A decentralized reliability-enhanced power sharing strategy for PV-based microgrids, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, 36, 6, pp. 7281-7293, (2020); Choudhury S., A comprehensive review on issues, investigations, control and protection trends, technical challenges and future directions for Microgrid technology, International Transactions on Electrical Energy Systems, 30, 9, (2020); Firdaus A., Mishra S., Auxiliary signal-assisted droopbased secondary frequency control of inverter - based PV microgrids for improvement in power sharing and system stability, IET Renewable Power Generation, 13, 13, pp. 2328-2337, (2019); Eskandari M., Li L., Moradi M.H., Siano P., Blaabjerg F., Active power sharing and frequency restoration in an autonomous networked microgrid, IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 34, 6, pp. 4706-4717, (2019); Yao Y., Ertugrul N., An overview of hierarchical control strategies for microgrids, 2019 29th Australasian Universities Power Engineering Conference (AUPEC), pp. 1-6, (2019); Khayat Y., Et al., On the secondary control architectures of AC microgrids: An overview, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, 35, 6, pp. 6482-6500, (2019); Ahmed K., Seyedmahmoudian M., Mekhilef S., Mubarak N., Stojcevski A., A review on primary and secondary controls of inverter-interfaced microgrid, Journal of Modern Power Systems Clean Energy, 9, 5, pp. 969-985, (2020); Sheykhi N., Salami A., Guerrero J.M., Agundis-Tinajero G.D., Faghihi T., A comprehensive review on telecommunication challenges of microgrids secondary control, International Journal of Electrical Power Energy Systems, 140, (2022); Rashwan A., Mikhaylov A., Senjyu T., Eslami M., Hemeida A.M., Osheba D.S., Modified droop control for microgrid power- sharing stability improvement, Sustainability, 15, 14, (2023); Dheer D.K., Gupta Y., Doolla S., A self-adjusting droop control strategy to improve reactive power sharing in islanded microgrid, IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energyvol., 11, 3, pp. 1624-1635, (2019); Irmak E., Guler N., Kabalci E., Calpbinici A., A modified droop control method for PV systems in island mode DC microgrid, 2019 8th International Conference on Renewable Energy Research and Applications (ICRERA), pp. 1008-1013, (2019); De Nadai N.B., Et al., Centralised secondary control for islanded microgrids, IET Renewable Power Generation, 14, 9, pp. 1502-1511, (2020); Shahid M.U., Et al., Renewable energy source (RES) based islanded DC microgrid with enhanced resilient control, J International Journal of Electrical Power Energy Systems, 113, pp. 461-471, (2019); Paylakhi S.Z., Pariz N., Bayaz M.H.J.D., Sistani M.B.N., Distributed secondary control of islanded microgrids using modified integral backstepping technique, International Journal of Dynamics Control, 10, 6, pp. 2011-2019, (2022); Madani S.S., Kammer C., Karimi A., Data-driven distributed combined primary and secondary control in microgrids, IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology, 29, 3, pp. 1340-1347, (2020); Simpson-Porco J.W., Dorfler F., Bullo F., Shafiee Q., Guerrero J.M., Stability, power sharing, & distributed secondary control in droop-controlled microgrids, 2013 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm), pp. 672-677, (2013); Hassouneh M.A., Lee H.-C., Abed E.H., Washout filters in feedback control: Benefits, limitations and extensions, Proceedings of the 2004 American control conference, 5, pp. 3950-3955, (2004); Yazdanian M., Leitner S., Fouladi E., Mehrizi-Sani A., Muetze A., Small signal stability of washout filter-based power sharing for an inverter-based microgrid, The Journal of Engineering, 2023, 2, (2023); Matharani K., Jariwala H., Stability analysis of microgrid with passive, active, and dynamic load, Journal of Operation Automation in Power Engineering, 11, 4, pp. 295-306, (2023)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","1st Middle East and North Africa Solar Conference, MENA-SC 2023","15 November 2023 through 18 November 2023","Dubai","196124","","978-166549146-4","","","English","Middle East North Africa Sol.

Then, the PC_Eff gradually decreased as the SOC was approaching full charge, which was considered to be beneficial feature for preventing over charge. In the case of appropriate load connection with sufficiently charged batteries, the PC_Eff reached over 99% during whole daytime from spring to winter by the self-tuning functions of the directly integrated devices with the solar cells and the batteries.

Designers and operators are carrying out reliability studies essentially to optimize project profitability as a function of income and expense factors such as capital expenditures, operating expenditures, production rate, the frequency of equipment failures and the associated downtime for such failures. Reliability Availability and Maintainability (RAM) studies are used to predict system availability, identify ways to improve system availability, throughput performance and the efficiency of solar plant from a cost/benefit point of view. The models generated require data to predict capacity as in uptime or revenue profile forward. Reliability expressed in Mean Time Between Failures and Maintainability expressed as the average time to return failed item to service (Mean Time to Repair) are based on rule sets and assumptions for different technologies. Component data is provided by the suppliers (e.g. laboratory testing/inspection), rather than years of operational excellence, as the industry is not as mature as conventional power plants. The sun's intermittency of power output affects the investment requirements to distinguish between installed capacity and electricity actually generated due to unpredictable nature of solar radiations. Tower-based Concentrated Solar Plants (CSP) holds out the advantages of thermal energy storage while the solar field is available only during the day. These constraints needs to be adequately captured in the analysis in order to assess the reliability and energy contribution of the solar system to meet overall system demand. A particular case study is presented for a CSP facility.  © 2023 IEEE.","","Constraint satisfaction problems; Economics; Electric energy storage; Heat storage; Maintainability; Mean time between failures; Reliability analysis; Throughput; Abundant resources; Capital expenditures; Concentrated solar; Current limitation; Power; Production rates; Renewables; Solar plant; Spectra's; System availability; Investments","","","","","","","Bosnjakovic M., Tadijanovic V., Environment impact of a concentrated solar power plant, Environmental Science, Engineering, (2019); BS EN 60812:2006 Analysis techniques for system reliability., (2006); 762-2006 - IEEE Standard Definitions for Use in Reporting Electric Generating Unit Reliability, (2010); Onshore and Offshore Reliability Data (OREDA) Handbook, 1, (2009); Quanterion Solutions Incorporated, Nonelectric Parts Reliability Data Publication (NPRD), (2016); IEEE Recommended Practice for the Design of Reliable Industrial and Commercial Power Systems, (1997); ISO 14224, Collection and Exchange of Reliability and Maintenance Data for Equipment, (2016)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","1st Middle East and North Africa Solar Conference, MENA-SC 2023","15 November 2023 through 18 November 2023","Dubai","196124","","978-166549146-4","","","English","Middle East North Africa Sol.

The DEWA BIPV Cube, installed in 2017, is an example of applying passive cooling techniques in BIPV. It features a double-skin facade that allows natural ventilation conditions for the back side of PV modules. Temperature and energy yield were measured continuously on two different module types, crystalline Si (C-Si) and Cu(In, Ga)(Se, S)2 (CIGS). C-Si modules have lower module operating temperatures than CIGS modules. The maximum temperature for both types was slightly above 70°C (Level 1 of IEC TS 63126). C-Si modules still obtain higher energy yields, although C-Si has a higher temperature coefficient. The results of this study indicate that C-Si modules have lower power degradation rates in facades with about l%/year, while CIGS modules degrade up to three times faster than C-Si modules.  © 2023 IEEE.","BIPV; C-Si; CIGS; Desert climate; Energy yield degradation; Module temperature study; Vertical Façade","Degradation; Facades; Silicon compounds; Temperature; Ventilation; Building integrated pv (BIPV); CIGS; Crystalline Si; Desert climates; Energy yield degradation; Energy yields; Module temperature; Module temperature study; Temperature study; Vertical facade; Yield degradation; Solar panels","","","","","","","Alhammadi N., Rodriguez-Ubinas E., Alzarouni S., Alantali M., Building integrated photovoltaics in hot climates: Experimental study of CIGS and c-Si modules in BIPV ventilated facades, Energy Convers Manag, 274, (2022); Anton M., Vaquero J.M., Aparicio A.J.P., The controversial early brightening in the first half of 20th century: A contribution from pyrheliometer measurements in Madrid (Spain), Glob Planet Change, 115, pp. 71-75, (2014); Jiang H., Lu N., Yao L., Qin J., Liu T., Impact of climate changes on the stability of solar energy: Evidence from observations and reanalysis, Renew Energy, 208, pp. 726-736, (2023); Elnosh A., Et al., Field study of factors influencing performance of PV modules in buildings (BIPV/BAPV) installed in UAE, 2018 IEEE 7th World Conference on Photovoltaic Energy Conversion (WCPEC), IEEE, pp. 565-568, (2018); Noaman D.S., Moneer S.A., Megahed N.A., Sherihan A.E.-G., Integration of active solar cooling technology into passively designed facade in hot climates, Journal of Building Engineering, (2022); IEC TS 63126:2020: Guidelines for qualifying PV modules, components and materials for operation at high temperatures, IEC, (2020)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","1st Middle East and North Africa Solar Conference, MENA-SC 2023","15 November 2023 through 18 November 2023","Dubai","196124","","978-166549146-4","","","English","Middle East North Africa Sol.

One of the most significant challenges is to identify a proper list of medical equipment that requires replacement and then to optimize this list. In this article, we present a new approach to solve this problem by integrating Quality Function Deployment (QFD) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) in one framework. In a previous application, QFD has proven its validity to solve the priority problem; meanwhile GA is an optimization method. Hence, the proposed model, QFD-GA, was developed to prioritize the medical equipment for replacement process taking into account a set of criteria; in addition, the prioritized list is optimized according to the available budget of the hospital to maximize the number of replaced devices. The validation of the proposed model was carried out on sixty devices that include different types of medical equipment in one public hospital. Results show that the proposed model can efficiently classify the priority into four subcategories, and simultaneously maximize the number of medical equipment to be replaced considering the budget constraint. © 2014 IEEE.","genetic algorithms; medical equipment; priority; quality function deployment; replacement","Biomedical engineering; Biomedical equipment; Budget control; Hospitals; Medical problems; Quality function deployment; Budget constraint; Complex problems; New approaches; Optimization method; priority; Quality function deployments (QFD); replacement; Genetic algorithms","","","","","","","Kierulff H.E., The replacement decision: Getting it right, Business Horizons, 50, pp. 231-237, (2007); Ouda B.K., Mohamed A.S.A., Saleh N.S.K., A simple quantitative replacement model for replacement of medical equipment proposed for developing countries,, Proc. 5th Cairo International Biomedical Engineering Cotif.

In this paper, a model has been introduced that integrates Weighted Permutation Entropy (WPE) as input feature to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning model to enhance the sensitivity and precision of the detection process. WPE is a modified statistical parameter of the permutation entropy (PE) that measures the complexity and irregularity of a time series. It incorporates both the mapped ordinal pattern of the time series and the information contained in the amplitude of its sample points. The proposed system utilizes the fact that entropy based measures for the EEG segments during epileptic seizure are lower than in normal EEG. Experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the sensitivity and precision of the proposed model. Results showed that the model can considerably discriminate between EEG brain signal into seizure and no-seizure classes. © 2014 IEEE.","Electroencephalogram (EEG); Epileptic Seizure Detection; Support Vector Machine (SVM); Weighted Permutation Entropy (WPE)","Biomedical engineering; Entropy; Neurodegenerative diseases; Neurophysiology; Support vector machines; Time series; Automatic seizure detections; Electro-encephalogram (EEG); Electroencephalogram signals; Epileptic seizure detection; Epileptic seizures; Long-term scalp EEG; Permutation entropy; Statistical parameters; Electroencephalography","","","","","","","Epilepsy "" Fact Sheets; Pati S., Alexopoulos A., Pharmacoresistant epilepsy: From pathogenesis to current and emerging therapies, Cleveland Clinic 1.

However, quantification of the global function from tMRI is challenging due to the low contrast between myocardium and blood in these images, and hence, prevents the accurate segmentation of the myocardium. In this work, a method for enhancing the myocardium-to-blood contrast in tagged MR images is presented. First, the tag pattern in tMRI is removed by accurately suppressing the frequency components of the tag pattern to produce tagless images. Then, the image contrast is enhanced by estimating the local standard deviation and using it to suppress the blood signal intensity. The proposed method is applied on a dataset for 12 patients to calculate the global cardiac functional parameters. The results are then compared to those calculated from standard cine MRI image sequences of the same patients. The results show that the proposed method can be used to accurately estimate the left ventricular volume and mass. © 2014 IEEE.","Global function estimation; Left Ventricular Segmentation; Tag removal; Tagged MRI","Biomedical engineering; Blood; Image enhancement; Image segmentation; Functional parameters; Global functions; Left ventricular; Left ventricular mass; Local standard deviation; Quantitative assessments; Tag removal; Tagged MRI; Magnetic resonance imaging","","","","","","","Camera O., Oubel E., Piella G., Balocco S., De Craene M., Frangi A., Multi-sequence registration of cine and delay-enhancement mri with shift correction and steerable pyramide-based detagging, F1MH, pp. 330-338, (2009); Domier C., Somsen G.A., Ivancevic M.K., Osman N.F., Didier D., Righetti A., Vallee J.-P., Comparison between Tagged MRI and Standard Cine MRI for Evaluation of Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction, pp. 1348-1352, (2004); Qian Z., Huang R., Metaxas D.N., Axel L., A novel tag removal technique for tagged cardiac mri and its applications, ISBI, pp. 364-367, (2007); Sayed M.R., Fahmy A.S., Evaluation of the cardiac global function from tagged magnetic resonance images, ISPHT, (2012); Ei-Rewaidy H., Khalifa A., Fahmy A., Accurate estimation of the myocardium global function from reduced magnetic resonance image acquisitions, 36th Annual International IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Coriference, (2014)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","7th Cairo International Biomedical Engineering Conference, CIBEC 2014","11 December 2014 through 13 December 2014","Giza","110277","","978-147994412-5","","","English","Proc.

The building sector is a critical sector for high consumption, contributing to about 36% of the total global energy consumption in 2020. The global interest in reducing energy consumption allows different sectors to adopt renewable resources such as solar photovoltaics (PV). However, utilizing solar PV in buildings has limitations due to rooftop space constraints in newly designed buildings. Due to this limitation and continuous innovation in solar PV technologies, Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) have been introduced as a potential alternative for solar PV in buildings. As such, BIPV energy performance and panel temperatures are affected by many factors such as orientation setup and technology type. Therefore, this research aims to analyze the impact of technology type (indium gallium selenide (CIGS) and monocrystalline (MONO) & orientation on BIPV energy production & module temperature. The data used for this study is based on a project completed in Dubai for BIPV in building applications. The results indicate that BIPV type and system orientation during each session significantly affect BIPV energy production and BIPV module temperature.  © 2023 IEEE.","","Buildings; Gallium compounds; Layered semiconductors; Population statistics; Solar panels; Solar power generation; Building integrated photovoltaic; Energy productions; Energy-consumption; Global energy; In-buildings; Module temperature; Performances analysis; Photovoltaic energy; Population growth; Solar photovoltaics; Energy utilization","","","","","","","Li X., Et al., An integrated building energy performance evaluation method: From parametric modeling to GA-NN based energy consumption prediction modeling, Journal of Building Engineering, 45, (2022); United Nations Environment Programme, (2021); Pillai D.S., Shabunko V., Krishna A., A comprehensive review on building integrated photovoltaic systems: Emphasis to technological advancements, outdoor testing, and predictive maintenance, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 156, (2022); Ghaleb B., Asif M., Application of solar PV in commercial buildings: Utilizability of rooftops, Energy Build., 257, (2022); Good C., Andresen I., Hestnes A.G., Solar energy for net zero energy buildings - A comparison between solar thermal, PV and photovoltaic-thermal (PV/T) systems, Solar Energy, 122, pp. 986-996, (2015); Krarti M., Dubey K., Review analysis of economic and environmental benefits of improving energy efficiency for UAE building stock, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 82, pp. 14-24, (2018); Santos I.P.D., Ruther R., The potential of buildingintegrated (BIPV) and building-applied photovoltaics (BAPV) in single-family, urban residences at low latitudes in Brazil, Energy Build., 50, pp. 290-297, (2012); Dai Y., Bai Y., Performance improvement for building integrated photovoltaics in practice: A review, Energies, 14, 1, (2020); Rodriguez-Ubinas E.D.W.I.N., Alhammadi N., Alantali M., Alzarouni S., Building integrated photovoltaic solutions in arid climates: Experimental analysis of copper indium gallium selenide and crystalline silicon modules integrated as ventilated façades, eco-architecture viii: harmonisation between architecture and nature, 195, (2020)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","1st Middle East and North Africa Solar Conference, MENA-SC 2023","15 November 2023 through 18 November 2023","Dubai","196124","","978-166549146-4","","","English","Middle East North Africa Sol.

Measurements on neuro-images to ascertain severity and extent of the pathology or trauma are routinely performed, however, poor perception, inaccurate deduction, incomplete knowledge or the quality of the image can affect the intuition of the doctor leading to errors and variation. In this paper we present a novel, hybrid technique for segmentation of significant anatomical landmarks using template matching, artificial neural networks and level sets, and estimation of various ratios and indices as well as haematoma volume on brain CT scans. The proposed method is efficient and robust in segmenting cross-sectional, noncontrast CT scans and has been evaluated on images from subjects with different ages and both genders. The proposed method has an average ICC ≥ 0.97 and Jaccard Index ≥ 0.86 compared with the experts. Hence, our approach can be used in processing data for further use in research and clinical environment to provide second opinions very close to the experts' intuition. © 2014 IEEE.","","Biomedical engineering; Clinical research; Data handling; Diagnosis; Image segmentation; Medical imaging; Neural networks; Template matching; Anatomical landmarks; Clinical environments; Different ages; Hybrid techniques; Incomplete knowledge; Interobserver variability; Jaccard index; Second opinions; Computerized tomography","","","","","","","Zhang Y., Londos E., Minthon L., Wattmo C., Liu H., Aspelin P., Wahlund L.O., Usefulness of computed tomography linear measurements in diagnosing alzheimer's disease, Acta Radiologica, 49, 1, pp. 91-97, (2008); Donald J.J., Barnard S.A., Common patterns in 558 diagnostic radiology errors, Journal of Medical Imaging and Radiation Oncology, 56, 2, pp. 173-178, (2012); Robinson P., Radiology's achilles' heel: Error and variation in the interpretation of the rontgen image, British Journal of Radiology, 70, 839, pp. 1085-1098, (1997); Jiang Y., Nishikawa R.M., Schmidt R.A., Toledano A.Y., Doi K., Potential of computer-aided diagnosis to reduce variability in radiologists interpretations of mammograms depicting microcalcifications, Radiology, 220, 3, pp. 787-794, (2001); Freedman M., Osicka T., Reader variability: What we can learn from computer-aided detection experiments, Journal of the American College of Radiology: JACR, 3, 6, (2006); Shiraishi J., Li Q., Appelbaum D., Doi K., Computer-aided diagnosis and artificial intelligence in clinical imaging, Seminars in Nuclear Medicine, 41, 6, pp. 449-462, (2011); Saatman D., Bullock M., Valadka M., Team W.S., Members A.P., Classification of traumatic brain injury for targeted therapies, Journal of Neurotrauma, 25, 7, pp. 19-738, (2008); Qureshi A.N., Schetinin Y., Computer-aided segmentation and estimation of indices in brain ct scans, Medical Image Understanding and Analysis-MIUA 2014. 18th Annual Conference, pp. 161-166, (2014); Vantaram S.R., Saber E., Survey of contemporary trends in color image segmentation, Journal of Electronic Imaging, 21, 4, pp. 040901-040911, (2012); Giesel F., Hahn H., Thomann P., Widjaja E., Wignall E., Von Tenggkobligk H., Pantel J., Griffiths P., Peitgen H., Schroder J., Et al., Temporal horn index and volume of medial temporal lobe atrophy using a new semiautomated method for rapid and precise assessment, American Journal of Neuroradiology, 27, 7, pp. 1454-1458, (2006); Tao W., Jin H., Zhang Y., Color image segmentation based on mean shift and normalized cuts, Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B: Cybernetics IEEE Transactions on, 37, 5, pp. 1382-1389, (2007); Chuang K.-S., Tzeng H.-L., Chen S., Wu J., Chen T.-J., Fuzzy c-means clustering with spatial information for image segmentation, Compo Med.

Being the lowest-cost renewable resource, investment in photovoltaic solar can be prioritized if the reliability of continuous generation is guaranteed. Micro defects in PV cells can reduce the electrical output and if not detected can lead to large-scale power distributions. Therefore, electroluminescence (EL) image is commonly used these days to detect these micro defects and classify the various types of these defects. Hence, a hybrid approach consisting of Alibi detection algorithm is proposed, which makes use of a deep learning-based approach to detect abnormal solar cells. And decision tree is employed for the previously obtained outlier instance score to further classify it into the different kinds of defects present in the EL image of the solar cells. The proposed model is tested on the ELPV image dataset consisting of mono conventional crystalline silicon cells with above 97% accuracy.  © 2023 IEEE.","Alibi-Detect; Classification; Decision Tree; Electroluminescence; Outliers; Solar Cells","Crystalline silicon cells; Deep learning; Defects; Electroluminescence; Investments; Renewable energy; Silicon solar cells; Solar panels; Solar power generation; Statistics; Alibi-detect; Electrical output; Electroluminescence images; Hybrid approach; Low-costs; Micro-defects; Outlier; Photovoltaics; Power demands; Renewable resource; Decision trees","","","","","","","Solar pv - analysis - iea, (2023); Yahya Z., Lmane S., Hicham H., Ghassane A., Safia E.B.-L., Applied imagery pattern recognition for photovoltaic modules' inspection: A review on methods, challenges, and future development, Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments, 52, (2022); Fuyuki T., Kondo H., Yamazaki T., Takahashi Y., Uraoka Y., Photographic surveying of minority carrier diffusion length in polycrystalline silicon solar cells by electroluminescence, Applied Physics Letters, 86, 26, (2005); Fuyuki T., Kitiyanan A., Photographic diagnosis of crystalline silicon solar cells utilizing electroluminescence, Applied Physics A, 96, pp. 189-196, (2009); Stoicescu L., Reuter M., Werner J.H., Daylight luminescence for photovoltaic system testing, Proc. 22nd lnternational Photovoltaic Science and Engineering Conference, (2012); Demirci M., Beli N., Giimiiii A., Defective pv cell detection using deep transfer learning and el imaging, Proceedings Book, 311, (2019); Akram M.W., Li G., Jin Y., Chen X., Zhu C., Zhao X., Khaliq A., Faheem M., Ahmad A., Cnn based automatic detection of photovoltaic cell defects in electroluminescence images, Energy, 189, (2019); Tang W., Yang Q., Yan W., Deep learning-based algorithm for multi-type defects detection in solar cells with aerial el images for photovoltaic plants, CMES-Computer Modeling in Engineering & Sciences, 130, 3, (2022); Acharya A.K., Sahu P.K., Jena S.R., Deep neural network based approach for detection of defective solar cell, Materials Today: Proceedings, 39, pp. 2009-2014, (2021); Wang J., Bi L., Sun P., Jiao X., Ma X., Lei X., Luo Y., Deeplearning- based automatic detection of photovoltaic cell defects in electroluminescence images, Sensors, 23, 1, (2022); Chen X., Karin T., Jain A., Automated defect identification in electroluminescence images of solar modules, Solar Energy, 242, pp. 20-29, (2022); Buerhop-Lutz C., Deitsch S., Maier A., Gallwitz F., Berger S., Doll B., Hauch J., Camus C., Brabec C.J., A benchmark for visual identification of defective solar cells in electroluminescence imagery, 35th European PV Solar Energy Conference and Exhibition, pp. 1287-1289, (2018); Looveren A.Y., Vacanti G., Klaise J., Coca A., Alibi-detect: Algorithms for outlier and adversarial instance detection, concept drift and metrics, GitHub repository, (2019); Deitsch S., Christlein V., Berger S., Buerhop-Lutz C., Maier A., Gallwitz F., Riess C., Automatic classification of defective photovoltaic module cells in electroluminescence images, Solar Energy, 185, pp. 455-468, (2019); Deitsch S., Buerhop-Lutz C., Sovetkin E., Steland A., Maier A., Gallwitz F., Riess C., Segmentation of photovoltaic module cells in uncalibrated electroluminescence images, 32, 4","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","1st Middle East and North Africa Solar Conference, MENA-SC 2023","15 November 2023 through 18 November 2023","Dubai","196124","","978-166549146-4","","","English","Middle East North Africa Sol.

Through this integration, a new generation profile is introduced to the existing supply profile, which imbalances the supply-demand of electric loads. Another noteworthy constraint is the dependency of the PV power generation on intermittent meteorological conditions, which profoundly impacts the continuity and quality of the generation. To address the raised constraints, the electricity generation profile demands thorough analysis to ensure stability of electrical grids. From this perspective, this paper proposes forecasting the PV power output for a short-term duration to overcome the constraints. Seven years (2014-2020) of historical data for a power plant in the United Arab Emirates were used to generate the forecasts. A hybrid forecasting approach was implemented, combining the emerging machine learning algorithms Prophet and Neural Prophet. Three univariate meteorological submodels (temperature, global irradiance, humidity) were built individually using the Neural Prophet algorithm. The power forecasting model was built using the Prophet algorithm, which utilized the meteorological forecasts and historical power readings. The results of the forecasts indicated good performance compared to the individual Prophet model.  © 2023 IEEE.","Gulf; machine learning; Neural Prophet; photovoltaic; Prophet; PV; PV power forecasting; renewable energy; UAE; United Arab Emirates","Electric loads; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Power quality; Gulf; Machine-learning; Neural prophet; Photovoltaics; Power forecasting; Prophet; PV; PV power forecasting; Renewable energies; UAE; United Arab Emirates; Machine learning","","","","","Rochester Institute of Technology, RIT","We would like to extend our profound gratitude to Dr. Sanjay Modak, Chair of Graduate Programs and Research at RIT Dubai and to Dr. Boutheina Tlili, Associate Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering, who served as our research mentor.

This circuit uses electronic parameters of the solar cell. The values of these electronic parameters are derived from a physics-based circuit model of the solar cell. The power extraction circuit provides a perfect impedance match between the output side of the solar cell and the input side of the circuit. This allows the power extraction circuit to extract all the electrical power generated in the solar cell. The circuit then transfer all power to the load, irrespective of load value. Experimental results for the output power of a single cell are presented. These results show that the power delivered to a load is independent of the load value. Also, these results show that power delivered to the load can be increased many times for a large range of load values. Because of the increased output power, it is expected that further development of this technique can results in greatly reduced cost, weight, and size of the solar systems. The new technique is also applicable to solar panels as well as to other high-impedance sources of electrical energy such as fuel cells.  © 2023 IEEE.","","Electric loads; Extraction; Impedance matching (electric); Solar panels; Electronic parameters; Extraction circuits; High frequency power; Load independent; Load values; New high; Output characteristics; Output power; Power; Power extraction; Fuel cells","","","","","SS Power Technology; Ohio State University, OSU","Most of the experimental work was performed at the Ohio State University under a contract from SS Power Technology.

Early detection is the most important step to solve this problem. Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CMR) has shown its capability of imaging the heart and evaluation of cardiac function without exposure to ionizing radiation. In this paper, we aim to perform automatic heart localization in MRI short axis view using a simple and effective way. The proposed algorithm can be described through the following two steps: (a) preprocessing step to denoise the images using Gaussian filter, and (b) localization step based on shape recognition technique. The algorithm, implemented using MATLAB, was developed and tested using two datasets. First one consists of 33 subjects normal and abnormal for a total of 7980 2D images and the second one consists of 50 2D images related to normal subject. The results here are evaluated through the classification into three types: totally localized case (complete heart falls inside the selected ROI window), partially localized case (small part, less than 10%, of LV or RV falls outside the selected ROI window), and not localized case (more than 10% of the hearts falls outside the selected ROI window). It gives result with 91.4% accuracy for totally localized case, 8.1% for partially localized case, and 0.5% for not localized case. © 2014 IEEE.","Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CMR); Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs); heart localization; Hough transform; region of interest (ROI)","Biomedical engineering; Cardiology; Diseases; Hough transforms; Image segmentation; Ionizing radiation; Magnetic resonance imaging; Object recognition; Cardiac functions; Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging; Cardio-vascular disease; Gaussian filters; Localization method; Pre-processing step; Region of interest; Shape recognition; Heart","","","","","","","World Health Organization; Schwitter A., Et al., Mr-impact: Comparison of perfusion-cardiac magnetic resonance with single-photon emission computed tomography for the detection of coronary artery disease in a multi centre, multi vendor, randomized trial, European Heart Journal, 29, 4, pp. 480-489, (2008); Schollhuber A., Fully automatic segmentation of the myocardium in cardiac perfusion mrl, Engineering in Medicine, (2008); Adluru G., Dibella E.V.R., Whitaker R.T., Automatic segmentation of cardiac short axis slices in perfusion, Biomedical Imaging: Nano to Macro 2006. 3rd IEEE International Symposium On.

The first essential step in the process of stem cell isolation, sorting and culture is tissue dissociation into single cell suspension. Tissue dissociation efficiency determines the number of resulting viable cells which in turn could affect the feasibility of the subsequent stem cell application. Microfluidic based platforms could provide several advantages over current conventional tissue dissociation techniques (e.g. mechanical or enzymatic or both) and help the optimization of the process towards a better reproducible cellular outcome. Objective: To develop a simple miniaturized platform for endometrial tissue dissociation which can be used to evaluate and optimize experimental conditions necessary for producing single cell suspension with minimal cell damage. Methods: A Poly-DiMethylSiloxane (PDMS) channel microfluidic platform was designed. The platform includes a tissue dissociation chamber where raw endometrial tissue was incubated. Trypsin was delivered through an inlet channel while another inlet enabled parallel delivery of a cell suspension medium and an outlet channel received the downstream dissociated endometrial cells. A cell size based filtration step is designed to trap large debris using two rows of posts. A viability stain is used to test the viability of cells produced at different enzyme-tissue contact durations. Conclusion: We present a simple microfluidics based platform for endometrial tissue dissociation that can be used for subsequent endometrial stem cell research applications and can be further applied to other tissues. © 2014 IEEE.","Endometrial tissue; Microfluidics; Tissue dissociation","Biomedical engineering; Cell culture; Dissociation; Microfluidics; Stem cells; Dissociation efficiency; Endometrial cells; Experimental conditions; Microfluidic platforms; Microfluidic-based; Polydimethylsiloxane PDMS; Single-cell suspensions; Stem cell research; Tissue","","","","","Science and Technology Development Fund, (5300)","","Chan R.W., Schwab K.E., Gargett C.E., Clonogenicity of human endometrial epithelial and stromal cells, Bioi Reprod, 70, 6, pp. 1738-1750, (2004); Schwab K.E., Chan R.W., Garget C.E., Putative stem cell activity of human endometrial epithelial and stromal cells during the menstrual cycle, Fertil Steril, 84, pp. 1124-1130, (2005); Garget C.E., Et al., Isolation and culture of epithelial progenitors and mesenchymal stem cells from human endometrium, Bioi Reprod, 80, 6, pp. 1136-1145, (2009); Vigano P., Et al., Culture of human endometrial cells: A new simple technique to completely separate epithelial glands, Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand, 72, 2, pp. 87-92, (1993); Duffy D.C., Et al., Rapid prototyping of microfluidic systems in poly(dimethylsiloxane, Anal Chern, 70, 23, pp. 4974-4984, (1998); Haubert K., Drier T., Beebe D., Pdms bonding by means of a portable low-cost corona system, Lab Chip, 6, 12, pp. 1548-1549, (2006); Hattersley S.M., Et al., Development of a microfluidic device for the maintenance and interrogation of viable tissue biopsies, Lab Chip, 8, 11, pp. 1842-1846, (2008)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","7th Cairo International Biomedical Engineering Conference, CIBEC 2014","11 December 2014 through 13 December 2014","Giza","110277","","978-147994412-5","","","English","Proc.

PV power generation is subject to very dynamic changes due to its dependence on the environment and the geography, often fluctuating erratically. The variability of PV power generation poses electric grid system stability, reliability, and planning downturns. Hence, grid operations could operate at higher levels of performance and efficiencies through adequate grid scheduling that primarily relies on accurate prediction of photovoltaic power output. Due to the paramount importance of the topic, the research community investigated several forecasting strategies that rely on numerical methods, probabilistic methods, physical models and machine learning-based (ML-based) techniques. The present paper presents a comparative review of the literature targeting ML-based algorithms for short-term PV power output prediction. A complementary case study exposes a much-needed homogeneous comparison of the state-of-the-art ML-based forecasters, trained on a dataset from the University of Liège. Model structural enhancement for the state-of-the-art is proposed and evaluated in the light of literature findings.  © 2023 IEEE.","","Forecasting; Global warming; Numerical methods; Smart power grids; Solar power generation; System stability; Dynamic changes; Electric grids; Exponential rates; Machine-learning; Photovoltaic power; Photovoltaic power generation; Power; Power output; Solar photovoltaic energies; State of the art; Machine learning","","","","","","","Raza M.Q., Nadarajah M., Ekanayake C., On recent advances in PV output power forecast, Sol Energy, 136, pp. 125-144, (2016); Reinders A., Verlinden P., Freundlich A., Photovoltaic Solar Energy: from Fundamentals to Applications, (2017); Global Energy Transformation, A Roadmap to 2050, (2018); Raza M.Q., Nadarajah M., Ekanayake C., On recent advances in PV output power forecast, Sol.

With the complex brain structure, for an accurate investigation of the influence of such brain injuries, accurate realistic geometrical brain structures must be developed. The objective of the current simulation study is to present the steps undertaken to generate a high resolution finite element model for human brains that will assist in studying the effects of a wide a spectrum mechanical insult to human heads. In this study, an MRI-T1 DICOM data files for healthy male head have been used for segmenting and extracting the brain structure. The segmented brain model has been meshed using tetrahedral elements with maximum size of 2 mm. This HRFEM for the brain was composed of 116,394 nodes and 607,457 elements. The model was then subjected to a simulated shock wave of 0.3 MPa peak pressure from anterior direction. This was simulated using the ConWep module available in the LSDYNA explicit finite element modeling software. Three dimensional plots of maximum pressure and maximum stress clearly demonstrated significant effects of the dynamic shock load. The generated HRFEM for the brain and the simulation results demonstrate the capability of the modeling approach in describing the brain response under shock-type loads, including those caused by blast wave. © 2014 IEEE.","Brain Segmentation; High-resolution Finite Element Models; Shock Loads; Traumatic Brain Injury","Biomedical engineering; Brain; Brain models; Shock waves; Brain segmentation; Current simulation; Explicit finite elements; High resolution; Shock load; Tetrahedral elements; Three dimensional plots; Traumatic Brain Injuries; Finite element method","","","","","","","Tagliaferri F., Compagnone C., Korsic M., Servadei F., Kraus L., A Systematic Review of Brain Injury Epidemiology, 148, pp. 255-268, (2006); Taylor P.A., Ford C.C., Simulation of early-time head impact leading to traumatic brain injury, International Brain Injury Association, (2007); Charras G.T., Guldberg R.E., Improving the local solution accuracy of large-scale digital image-based finite element analyses, Journal of Biomechanics, 33, pp. 255-259, (2000); Cloots R.J.H., Gerv Aise H.M.T., Et al., Biomechanics of Traumatic Brain Injury: Influences of the Morphologic Heterogeneities of the Cerebral Cortex Annals of Biomedical Engineering, 36, 7, pp. 1203-1215, (2008); Takhounts E.G., Eppinger R.H., Campbell A.Q., Tannous R.E., Power E.D., Shook A.S., On the development of the simon finite element head model, Stapp Car Crash Conference Proceedings, Society of Automotive Engineers, 47, pp. 107-133; Raul I.S., Baumgartner D., Willinger R., Ludes B., Finite element modeling of human head injuries caused by a fall, Int. 1.

In this study the influence of ventilation on CC performance during NCPR was investigated by measuring the CC depth and force during simulated unventilated and ventilated NCPR using an infant training manikin. The results obtained indicate that ventilation may exert a significant influence on CC performance during NCPR due to dynamic changes in chest properties (i.e., stiffness and damping) which likely occur due to the high frequency of inflation and deflation of the manikin lungs during NCPR at the 3/1 CC to ventilation ratio recommended by the guidelines. © 2014 IEEE.","","Biomedical engineering; Cardiopulmonary resuscitation; Chest compressions; Dynamic changes; High frequency HF; Stiffness and damping; Resuscitation","","","","","","","Prasad S., Watcher D., Aitchison R., Et al., Neonatal resuscitation guidelines, Dis Mon, 59, 5, pp. 196-201, (2013); O'Rourke P.P., Outcome of children who are apneic and pulseless in the emergency room, Crit Care Med, 14, pp. 466-468, (1986); Friesen R.M., Duncan P., Tweed W.A., Et al., Appraisal of pediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation, Can Med Assoc J, 126, pp. 1055-1058, (1982); Mildenhall L.F., Huynh T.K., Factors modulating effective chest compressions in the neonatal period, Semin Fetal Neonatal Med, 18, 6, pp. 352-356, (2013); Perlman J.M., Risser R., Cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the delivery room.

Having the harmonic currents spectrum of each inverter already certified 'individually' does not ensure the compliance of accumulated spectrums from multiple of these inverters connected in parallel. As such, the accumulated harmonic current emissions from parallel PV inverters of certain Distributed Photovoltaic installations should be assessed in terms of their impact on the harmonic voltage levels throughout the network it's connected to. This work presents a detailed investigation and analysis to simulate and assess the levels of accumulated harmonic currents from a photovoltaic system with parallel PV inverters. The work contains derivations to generate emission limits based on the installed capacity of Distributed Photovoltaic installation and background harmonic voltage levels of the network. Furthermore, additional parameters have been considered, including the line impedance, topology of the point of connection, vector sum of harmonic orders, and others. The work presents an actual case study to assess the harmonic currents and voltages of a certain installation, based on which its integration approval with the grid has been decided by the network planners/operators.  © 2023 IEEE.","Distributed Photovoltaic; Distribution Network; Harmonics; Inverters; On-grid; Power quality","Electric inverters; Harmonic analysis; Installation; Distributed photovoltaic; Harmonic; Harmonic currents; Harmonic voltages; Inverter; On-grid; Photovoltaic installation; Photovoltaic systems; Photovoltaics; Voltage levels; Power quality","","","","","","","Feldman D., Margolis R., H2 2020 Solar Industry Update, (2021); Feldman D., Dummit K., Zuboy J., Heeter J., Xu K., Margolis R., Winetr 2021/2022 Solar Industry Update, (2022); Kagadi S.F., Joshi P.M., Impacts of high rooftop pv penetration in distribution network and its mitigation using dstatcom, The 7th Intentional Conference on Electrical Energy Systems (ICEES), pp. 1-4, (2021); Hurmeydan S., Rosin A., Vinnal T., Effects of PV microgeneration on rural LV network voltage quality - harmonics and unbalance, The Electric Power Quality and Supply Reliability (PQ), pp. 97-100, (2016); Ahmed I., Shames M., Alam M., An overview of harmonic sources in power system, Journal of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, 7, 3, pp. 1-3, (2013); Fiorina J., Inverters and harmonics: Case studies of non-linear loads, Merlin Gerin, Lyon, France, Technical Noteboob ECT 159, (1993); Armstrong M., Atkinson D., Johnson C., Low order harmonic cancellation in a grid connected multiple inverter system via current control parameter randomization, IEEE Trans.

The shape of the MultiPro-CPCs consists of multiple compound parabolic concentrator (CPC) profiles with different acceptance angles in the East-West and the North-South directions. The receiver shape of the solar concentrators proposed are respectively elliptical for the MultiPro-ECPC and rectangular for the MultiPro-RCPC. Here, in addition to their original size, the shapes are truncated at 3/4 and 1/2 of their heights. The annual energy collection performances of the truncated and non-truncated MultiPro-CPCs are compared to the one of the truncated and non-truncated conventional CPCs using ray tracing simulations. All simulations are set to Tokyo and the shapes are 75° tilted from the horizontal. It was found that among the simulated designs, the MultiPro-ECPCs generally collect more energy per receiver area between May 1st and August 15th. The maximum value obtained by the non truncated MultiPro-ECPC is 138 MJ/m2. The effect of the truncation is only noticeable when the concentrator height is halved. The halved concentrators have wider angular coverage which enables them to collect energy in April and September. On the other hand, the intensity of the energy collection per receiver area decreases with the truncation in the situations where the non-truncated concentrators take the highest values. Moreover, all truncated new designs show higher performance between May 1st and August 15th compared to the non-truncated conventional 3D PC. The obtained outcomes give an idea about the possibilities that the new family of MultiPro-CPCs may provide in the field of concentration when considering high-cost receivers and concentrator height limits.  © 2023 IEEE.","","Concentration (process); Design; Acceptance angle; Collection performance; Compound parabolic concentrator; Design method; Ellipticals; Energy; Energy collection; Performance; Ray tracing simulation; Truncation effects; Solar concentrators","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS; Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, TUAT","This study was supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science and by the Doctoral rPogram ofr World-leading Innovative & Smart Education of Tokyo university of Agriculture and Technology.","Leonardi M., Lombardo S., Effects of module temperature on the energy yield of bifacial photovoltaics, Energies, 15, (2022); Lu Z., Zhao Y., Performance investigation of a concentrated photovoltaic-thermoelectric hybrid system for electricity and cooling production, Applied Thermal Engineering, 231, (2023); Winston R., Juan C., Benitez P., Non-Imaging Optics, (2005)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","1st Middle East and North Africa Solar Conference, MENA-SC 2023","15 November 2023 through 18 November 2023","Dubai","196124","","978-166549146-4","","","English","Middle East North Africa Sol.

Due to blocking of UV rays from the solar spectrum, reduction in around 8°C in the temperature from the surface of the solar panel was observed when the solar panel coated with ZnO embedded resin was exposed to sunlight for 30 min as compared to the surface temperature from the reference panel with resin coating only.

However, this development has unavoidably led to the emergence of significant volumes PV waste considering 20-30 years life span before End of Life (EOL). The standard decision makers practices for PV EOL are disposal to the landfill, recycling, or reuse. Due to complexity of the decision environment, this study aims to analyze and rank solar PV disposition alternative using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) based on five main criteria including environmental, economic, social, policy and legislation and technical. AHP Aggregating Individual Priorities (AIP) aggregation method was utilized to evaluate the overall perspective of all the study participant. In addition, individual stakeholder group decision was assessed individually to understand potential different EOL disposition perspective from different stakeholder group. The findings of the analysis shows that the overall ranking of the alternatives based on the main criteria is leaning toward recycling compared to other alternatives.

Such components can be designed and integrated into UAV platforms to deliver structural, weight, area, performance, reliability, manufacturability, and other mission-enabling advantages, more so than separately attached, discrete technologies on UAV platforms which have more limited benefit. The paper highlights the importance of minimizing platform mass for long-endurance solar-electric UAV and proposes that by integrating PV modules in a PV-Plus mode to perform a material/structural role in the UAV, the added mass of the PV can be offset. Building on this foundation of structurally integrated PV-Plus modules, additional passive, active or control functionality can be added with attendant advantages. Further, the paper emphasizes the benefits of multi-functional integration for various applications and identifies that flexible PV solutions, based on III-V, CIGS and a-Si, are now at a level that constitutes suitable foundational technologies. The article also identifies building blocks that are in place for developing multi-functional PV-Plus solutions for a wider range of platforms and missions.  © 2023 IEEE.","","Silicon compounds; Solar panels; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Core components; Flexible thin-films; Manufacturability; Multi-functional; Performance; Performance reliability; PV modules; Structural weight; Vehicle platforms; Antennas","","","","","","","Formation of stretchable photovoltaic devices and carriers; Adaptable solar airframe with a flexible photovoltaic system; Integrated optical receiver skin; Multi-functional skin incorporating a photo-voltaic array and a RF antenna; Multi-layer deicing skin for aircraft platforms; Mobile system incorporating flexible and tunable anti-reflective skin and method of use; Multi-layer deicing skin for aircraft platforms: failure resistant, energy efficient and extended lifetime method of use; Photovoltaic device having a stretchable carrier; Mobile system incorporating flexible and tunable optically reflective skin and method of use; Methods and apparatus for thermal energy management in electric vehicles","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","1st Middle East and North Africa Solar Conference, MENA-SC 2023","15 November 2023 through 18 November 2023","Dubai","196124","","978-166549146-4","","","English","Middle East North Africa Sol.

This paper proposes a non-intrusive imaging system that utilizes ultraviolet technology to monitor the condition of components in small distributed generation plants. The system is designed to be mounted thermal camera on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), enabling thermal imaging of solar panels. Subsequently, the captured images undergo various image processing techniques to extract relevant geometric and statistical features. These processed data are then analyzed using a machine learning classifier algorithm, aiming to identify areas with defects. Multiple algorithms are employed and compared to enhance and assess the accuracy of defect identification. This innovative approach, combining UAV-based thermal imaging and machine learning, presents a promising solution for early defect detection in solar PV components. It has the potential to significantly improve maintenance practices and mitigate the risks of system failures.  © 2023 IEEE.","","Aircraft detection; Antennas; Defects; Machine components; Machine learning; Solar panels; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Catastrophic failures; Defect detection; Detection of defects; Early defects; Electrical components; Machine-learning; Solar PVs; Thermal machines; Thermal-imaging; Infrared imaging","","","","","","","EA, Global Energy & Co2 Status Report, (2022); World energy transitions outlook, (2022); Ali M.U., Et al., Early hotspot detection in photovoltaic modules using color image descriptors: An infrared thermography study, Int.

Transmittance test was conducted across different stages of each experiment. Our results revealed that the highest transmittance achieved was 88% (procedures 2 and 4), due to polishing the coupon after each sanding process. In addition, the clarity of the surface was the highest for both procedures; clear of scratches and smooth in comparison to the other 4 test procedures.

The spatial distribution of dust particles can be uniform or non-uniform, both negatively affecting the performance. However, the latter has more pronounced effects as it leads to partial shading, leading to current mismatching with reduced performance and the formation of hot spots. Hence, it is necessary to perform timely inspection of solar PV farms to detect and identify the distribution of dust. We propose a deep learning model for detecting dust levels on a PV module based on uniformity to achieve this objective. The workflow involves first segmenting the modules from the farm, followed by its individual localization, classification based on dust or no dust, and finally, classification based on uniformity of the dust deposition. The data is gathered using a drone equipped with a camera autonomously navigated using real-time kinetics (RTK). The overall accuracy of the classification model is more than 90 %. This enables a faster inspection process, which, combined with our algorithm, improves the overall efficiency and accuracy of the maintenance procedure.  © 2023 IEEE.","classification; deep learning;

Positive rheotaxis (PR) is the ability of sperm to swim against the flow. Our results show that PR is prevalent in bull sperm, which confirms rheotaxis as a strong mechanism for guiding sperm to the oocyte. Sperm can swim against secretions flowing downstream the female genital tract after coitus to reach the oocyte. We found that increasing flow velocity increases the percentage of sperm cells exhibiting PR and sperm swimming speed. PR sperm cells were found more likely to swim near channel walls, where local flow velocity is low, and cells were able to advance faster there compared with sperm at channel center. © 2014 IEEE.","microfluidics; rheotaxis; sperm; wall-tracking","Biomedical engineering; Flow velocity; Channel wall; rheotaxis; sperm; Sperm cells; Swimming speed; Wall tracking; Microfluidics","","","","","Science and Technology Development Fund, (4081, 4850)","","Gaffney E.A., Gadelha H., Smith D.J., Blake J.R., Kirkmanbrown J.C., Mammalian sperm motility: Observation and theory, Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics, 43, pp. 501-528, (2011); Eisenbach M., Giojalas L.C., Sperm guidance i n mammals-an unpaved road to the egg, Nat.

The ultimate performance limit of TMD solar cells is therefore of interest. In this study, we determine the power conversion efficiency limit of multilayer MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2 solar cells under AM 1.5 G illumination as a function of thickness and material quality. We use an extended version of the detailed balance method which includes Auger and Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombinations in addition to radiative losses, calculated from measured optical absorption spectra. We demonstrate that ultrathin TMD solar cells (as thin as 50 nm) can in practice achieve up to 25% power conversion efficiency with their current-stage material quality, already making them an excellent choice for high-specific-power photovoltaic applications.  © 2023 IEEE.","","Conversion efficiency; Energy gap; Layered semiconductors; Light absorption; Molybdenum compounds; Selenium compounds; Solar power generation; Tungsten compounds; Absorber material; Dichalcogenides; Materials quality; Optical absorption coefficients; Optoelectronics property; Performance limits; Photovoltaics; Power conversion efficiencies; Specific power; Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD); Transition metals","","","","","","","Reese M.O., Glynn S., Kempe M.D., McGott D.L., Dabney M.S., Barness T.M., Booth S., Feldman D., Haegel N.M., Increasing markets and decreasing package weight for highspecific- power photovoltaics, Nature Energy, 3, pp. 1002-1012, (2018); Jariwal D., Davoyan A.R., Wong J., Atwater H.A., Van der waals materials for atomically-thin photovoltaics: Promise and outlook, ACS Photonics, 4, pp. 2962-2970, (2017); Nazif K.N., Daus A., Hong J., Lee N., Vaziri S., Kumar A., Nitta F., Chen M.E., Kananian S., Islam R., Kim K.-H., Park J.-H., Poon A.S.Y., Brongersma M.L., Pop E., Saraswat K.C., High-specific-power flexible transition metal dichalcogenide solar cells, Nature Communications, 12, (2021); Went C., Wong J., Jahelka P.R., Kelzenberg M., Biswas S., Carbone A., Atwater H.A., A new metal transfer process for van der Waals contacts to vertical Schottky-junction transition metal dichalcogenide photovoltaics, Science Advances, 5, (2019); Tiedje T., Yablonovitch E., Cody G.D., Brooks B.G., Limiting efficiency of silicon solar cells, IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices, 31, pp. 711-716, (1984); Kravets V.G., Ellipsometry and optical spectroscopy of lowdimensional family TMDs, Semicond.

Automated system for the purpose of pigmented skin lesion diagnosis mentioned through that paper is recommended as a non-invasive diagnosis tool. To obviate the problem of qualitative interpretation, two different image sets are used to examine the proposed system, a set of images acquired by standard camera (clinical images) and another set of dermoscopic images captured from the magnified dermoscope. Images are enhanced and segmented to separate the lesion from the background. Different geometric and chromatic features are extracted from the region of interest resulting from segmentation process. Then, the most prominent features that can cause an effect are selected by different selection methods; which are the Fisher score ranking and the t-test method. Most prominent features were introduced to two different classifiers; artificial neural network and Support vector machine for the discrimination of the two groups of lesions. System performance was measured regarding Specificity, Sensitivity and Accuracy. The artificial neural network designed with the combined geometric and chromatic features selected by fisher score ranking enabled a diagnostic accuracy of 95% for dermoscopic and 93.75% for clinical images. © 2014 IEEE.","ANN; Color Space; Geometric features; Pigmented Skin lesions; SVM","Automation; Biomedical engineering; Dermatology; Geometry; Image segmentation; Neural networks; Support vector machines; Testing; Color space; Dermoscopic images; Diagnostic accuracy; Geometric feature; Non-invasive diagnosis; Pigmented skin lesions; Prominent features; Segmentation process; Image enhancement","","","","","","","Menzies S.W., Surface microscopy of pigmented skin tumors, Australas J Dermatol, 38, pp. 40-43, (1997); Argenziano G., Fabbrocini G., Carli P., De Giorgi V., Delfino M., Clinical and dermatoscopic criteria for the preoperative evaluation of cutaneous melanoma thickness, J Am Acad Dermatol, 40, pp. 61-68, (1999); Binder M., Chwarz M., Et al., Epiluminescence microscopy: A useful tool for the diagnosis of pigmented skin lesion for formally trained dermatologists, Archives of Dermatology, 131, pp. 286-291, (1995); Liu W., Hill D., Gibbs A., Tempany M., Howe C., Borland R., Morand M., Kelly J., What features do patients notice that help to distinguish between benign pigmented lesions and melanomas?: The abcd(e) rule versus the seven-point checklist, Melanoma Res, 15, 6, pp. 549-554, (2005); Nachbar F., Stolz W., Merkle T., Cognetta A.B., Vogt T., Landthaler M., Bilek P., Braun-Falco O., Plewig G., The abcd rule of dermatoscopy: High prospective value in the diagnosis of doubtful melanocytic skin lesions, J.

IMU units were used to measure the lower limb segment's angular velocity and linear acceleration as direct biomechanical variables. Meanwhile, Lower Limb joints and segments inclination, in the sagittal plane, were calculated indirectly, using IMUs' direct outputs. The outputs undergo several signal conditioning phases to remove noises and bias. Furthermore, misalignment effect on the raw data is removed by an on-body calibration of the sensors. Finally, for activity recognition purposes, T-test is used to prove that capturing motion along only one side of the lower limb is sufficient, due to redundancy in the corresponding features of the biomechanical signals (variables) of each leg. © 2014 IEEE.","IMU Sensor Network; Lower Limb Gait Analysis","Biomechanics; Biomedical engineering; Sensor networks; Activity recognition; Inertial measurement unit; Linear accelerations; Lower limb; Lower-limb motion; Misalignment effects; Motion capture system; Wireless connection; Motion analysis","","","","","","","Medved V., Measurement of Human Locomotion, (2000); Roetenberg D., Luinge H., Xsens MVN: Fu1l 6DOF Human Motion Tracking Using Miniature Inertial Sensors; Chen M., Huang B., Human abnormal gait modeling via hidden markiv model, International Conference on Infonnation Acquisition, pp. 517-522, (2007); Bonato P., Wearable sensors/systems and their impact on biomedical engineering, IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine, 22, 3, pp. 18-20, (2003); Moeslund T.B., Granum E., A Survey of Computer VisionBased Human Motion Capture, 81, pp. 231-268, (2001); Jeon P.W., Teleoperated control of mobile robot using exoskeleton type motion capturing device through wireless communication, International Conference in Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics, 2, pp. 1107-1112, (2003); Yabukami S., Motion capture system of magnetic markers using three axial magnetic field sensors, IEEE Transaction on Magnetics, 36, pp. 3646-3648, (2000); Luinge H.J., Veltink P.H., Measuring orientation of human body segments using miniature gyroscopes and accelerometers, Medical & Biological Engineering, 43, pp. 273-282, (2005); Tao Y., Hu H., A novel sensing and data fusion systems for 3-d ann motion tracking in telerehabilitation, IEEE Transaction on Instruments and Measurements, 57, pp. 1029-1040, (2008); Howell A.M., Kobayashi T., Rosenbaum T., A laboratory insole for analysis of sensor placement to determine ground reaction force and ankle moment in patients with stroke, IEEE EMBC, pp. 6394-6397, (2012); Scapello S., Cavallo F., Martelloni C., In-use calibration of body-mounted gyroscopes for applications in gait analysis, Sensors and Actuators A, pp. 418-422, (2005); Seel T., Raisch J., Schauer T., Imu-based joint angle measurement for gait analysis, Sensors, pp. 689I-6909, (2014); Rodrguez-Angeles A., Guzman-Gutierrez J.A., User wearable interface based on inertial sensors for unilateral master-slave robot teleoperation, 7th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Automatic Control, pp. 458-463, (2007); Zhang M.I., Sawchuk A.A., A feature selection-based framework for human activity recognition using wearablemultimodal sensors, BodyNets, (2011); Fish B., Khan A., Feature selection based on mutual infonnation for human activity recognition, ICASSP, pp. 1729-1732, (2012); Awinter D., Biomechanics and Motor Control of Human Movement, (2009)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","7th Cairo International Biomedical Engineering Conference, CIBEC 2014","11 December 2014 through 13 December 2014","Giza","110277","","978-147994412-5","","","English","Proc.

Thus, they are suitable for segmenting left ventricle cavity and computing left ventricle areas, volumes and some important clinical parameters like ejection fraction and myocardial mass. Many recent endocardium segmentation methods utilize optimal thresholding as simple and fast technique to segment left ventricle cavity. Unfortunately, intensity inhomogeneity decreases the efficiency of optimal thresholding. In this paper, we propose an automatic technique to overcome the aforementioned problems. The proposed technique is based mainly on Maximally Stable Extremal Regions (MSER) detector. The proposed technique consists of two main steps: First, generating of MSERs and Second, these regions were analyzed to select the region representing the LV cavity. The proposed technique was validated using 15 test sets from MICCAI 2009 LV segmentation challenge. Results were compared with thresholding-based method applied to the same dataset. Results show better performance in terms of segmentation accuracy and computation time. © 2014 IEEE.","cardiac MRI; image segmentation; MSER","Biomedical engineering; Magnetic resonance; Magnetic resonance imaging; Automatic segmentations; Cardiac magnetic resonance images; Cardiac MRI; Intensity inhomogeneity; Left ventricle cavity; Maximally Stable Extremal Regions; MSER; Thresholding-based methods; Image segmentation","","","","","","","Lorenz C.H., Walker E.S., Morgan V.L., Klein S.S., Graham T.P., Normal human right and left ventricular mass, systolic function, and gender differences by cine magnetic resonance imaging, J Cardiovasc Magn Reson, 1, pp. 7-21, (1999); Yeh F., Dixon A.E., Best L.G., Marion S.M., Lee E.T., Ali T., Et al., Lung function and heart disease in american indian adults with high frequency of metabolic abnormalities (from the strong heart study, The American Joumal of Cardiology, 114, pp. 312-319, (2014); Petitiean C., Dacher J.N., A review of segmentation methods in short axis cardiac mr images, Med Image Anal, 15, pp. 169-184, (2011); Lu Y.-L., Connelly K.A., Dick A.A., Wright G.A., Radau P.E., Automatic functional analysis of left ventricle in cardiac cine mri, Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery, 3, (2013); Huang S., Liu A., Lee L.C., Venkatesh S.K., San Teo L.L., Au C., Et al., An image-based comprehensive approach for automatic segmentation of left ventricle from cardiac short axis cine mr images, Journal of Digital Imaging, 24, pp. 598-608, (2011); Lynch M., Ghita O., Whelan P.F., Automatic segmentation of the left ventricle cavity and myocardium in mrl data, Comput Bioi Med, 36, pp. 389-407, (2006); Cocosco C., Netsch T., Senegas J., Bystrov D., Niessen W., Viergever M., Automatic Cardiac Region-Of-Interest Computation in Cine 3D Structural Mrl, (2008); Hu H., Liu H., Gao Z., Huang L., Hybrid segmentation of left ventricle in cardiac mri using gaussian-mixture model and region restricted dynamic programming, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, 31, pp. 575-584, (2013); Otsu N., A threshold selection method from gray-level histograms, Automatica, 2, pp. 23-27, (1975); Queiros S., Barbosa D., Heyde B., Morais P., Vila J.L., Friboulet D., Et al., Fast automatic myocardial segmentation in 4d cine cmr datasets, Medical Image Analysis, (2014); Matas J., Chum O., Urban M., Pajdla T., Robust wide-baseline stereo from maximally stable extremal regions, Image and Vision Computing, 22, pp. 761-767, (2004); Davies E.R., Machine Vision: Theory Algorithms Practicalities, (2004); Radau P., Lu Y., Connelly K., Paul G., Dick A., Wright G., Evaluation framework for algorithms segmenting short axis cardiac mri, Presented at the the MIDAS Journal-Cardiac MR Left Ventricle Segmentation Challenge, (2009); Lu Y., Radau P., Connelly K., Dick A., Wright G., Automatic image-driven segmentation of left ventricle in cardiac cine mri, The MIDAS Journal, 49, (2009); Dice L.R., Measures of the amount of ecologic association between species, Ecology, 26, pp. 297-302, (1945)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","7th Cairo International Biomedical Engineering Conference, CIBEC 2014","11 December 2014 through 13 December 2014","Giza","110277","","978-147994412-5","","","English","Proc.

It allows exploring the internal structures of volumetric data acquired by the different imaging modalities. This exploration allows accurate diagnosis and consequently effective treatment. Various volume rendering techniques exists. However, compared to other techniques, Fourier volume rendering has gained a wide acceptance by the radiologists for several reasons. This technique generates attenuation renderings similar to x-ray radiographs that are well interpreted by the physicians. Additionally, it works with time complexity of O(N2logN), and thus, it delivers interactive frame rates for large scale medical volumes in comparison with spatial-domain rendering techniques. The complexity associated with developing a basic rendering pipeline for this technique hinders medical imaging scientists from focusing their research on investigating new algorithms for improving the reconstruction quality of the resulting digital radiographs. In this paper, we present a flexible, extensible and semi-interactive high-level MATLAB-based framework for the Fourier volume rendering pipeline. © 2014 IEEE.","","Biomedical engineering; Diagnosis; Fourier transforms; Pipelines; Radiography; Volume rendering; Volumetric analysis; Fourier volume renderings; Imaging modality; Interactive frame rates; Internal structure; Reconstruction quality; Rendering pipelines; Spatial domains; Volumetric data; Medical imaging","","","","","","","Elvins T.T., A survey of algorithms for volume visualization, ACM SIGGRAPH Computer Graphics, 26, pp. 194-201, (1992); Elnokrashy A., Elmalky A., Hosny T., Ellah M., Megawer A., Elsebai A., Youssef A.-B., Kadah Y., Gpu-based reconstruction and display for 4d ultrasound data, Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS 2009 IEEE International, pp. 189-192; Charles C.R.J., Hansen D., The Visualization Handbook, (2005); MATLAB; Levoy M., Volume rendering using the fourier projection-slice theorem, Proceedings of Graphics Interface 1992 & Technical Report from, pp. 61-69, (1992); Malzbender T., Fourier volume rendering, ACM Transactions on Graphics, 9, 7, pp. 233-250, (2000); Totsuka T., Levoy M., Frequency domain volume rendering, Proceedings of S1GGRAPH 1993 & Technical Report from, (1993); Entezari A., Scoggins R., Moller T., Machiraju R., Shading for fourier volume rendering, IEEE Symposium on Volume Visualization and Graphics (VV 2002, pp. 131-138, (2002); Abdellah M., Eldeib A., Shaarawi A., Constructing a functional fourier volume rendering pipeline on heterogeneous platforms, Biomedical Engineering Conference (CIBEC), 2012 Cairo International, pp. 77-80, (2012); The Volume Library, (2012); Abdellah M., High Performance Fourier Volume Rendering on Graphics Processing Units, (2012); Abdellah M., Saleh S., Eldeib A., Shaarawi A., High performance multi-dimensional (2d/3d) fft-shift implementation on graphics processing units (opus, Biomedical Engineering Conference (CIBEC), 2012 Cairo International, pp. 171-174, (2012); Abdellah M., Cufftshift: High performance cuda-accelerated fftshift library, Proceedings of the High Performance Computing Symposium, Ser.

The most common method, Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation is an expensive procedure and requires highly trained staff. Respiratory Assist Catheters (RACs) could be used as an alternative because they do not place extra stress on the lungs, are easy to implement, cost-effective and are available for immediate use in clinical settings or in first aid situations. This paper describes experiments and simulations to evaluate the feasibility of intravenously oxygenating the blood using microbubbles. The tests included in vivo and ex vivo tests using animal models to investigate both the dissolution times of the microbubbles as well as the physiological effects of an intravenously placed device. Numerical simulations based on the dissolution rate of oxygen in venous blood were also completed. The results indicate that the dissolution times for the micro bubbles are too slow for the device to be successful in clinical practice. © 2014 IEEE.","dissolution; intravenous; microbubble; oxygenation","Biomedical engineering; Blood; Cost effectiveness; Dissolution; Physiological models; Respiratory therapy; Clinical practices; Clinical settings; Dissolution rates; Dissolution time; Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; intravenous; Micro-bubble; Physiological effects; Oxygenation","","","","","","","Schubert R.W., Conrad S.A., Kim S.S., Using microbubbles to oxygenate blood: Possible?, 251h Annual International Conference of the IEEE EMBS, pp. 16-19, (2003); Conrad S.A., Bagley A., Bagley B., Schaap R.N., Major findings from the clinical trials of the intravascular oxygenator, Artificial Organs, 18, 11, pp. 846-863, (1994); Frenckner B., Radell P., Respiratory failure and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, Seminars in Pediatric Surgery, 17, 1, pp. 34-41, (2008); Iwahashi H., Yuri K., Nose Y., Development of the oxygenator: Past, present, and future, Artificial Organs, 7, 3, pp. 111-120, (2004); Kaar H., Towards improved artificial lungs through biocatalysis, Biomaterials, 28, 20, pp. 3131-3139, (2007); Fischer M., Zinovik L., Poulikakos D., Diflusion and reaction controlled dissolution of oxygen microbubbles in blood, International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, 52, 21-22, pp. 5013-5019, (2009); Fazio R., The iterative transformation method: Numerical solution of one-dimensional parabolic moving boundary problems, International Journal of Computer Mathematics, 78, 2, pp. 213-223, (2001); Illingworth T.C., Golosnoy I.O., Numerical solutions of diffusion-controlled moving boundary problems which conserve solute, Journal of Computational Physics, 209, 1, pp. 207-225, (2005); Unverdi S.O., Tryggvason G., A front-tracking method for viscous , incompressible multi-fluid flows, Journal of Computational Physics, 100, pp. 25-37, (1992); Heidelberger E., Reeves R.B., Intransfer kinetics in a whole blood unicellular thin layer, Journal of Applied Physiology, 68, 5, pp. 1854-1864, (1990); Yang W., Echigo R., Wotton D.R., Hwang J.B., Experimental studies of the dissolution of gas bubbles in whole blood and plasma-i stationery bubbles, Journal of Biomechanics, 4, pp. 275-281, (1971); Yang W.A., Echigo R., Wotton O.R., Hwang A.B., Experimental studies of the dissolution of gas bubbles in whole blood and plasma-ii.

Due to the lack of standard meta-data description of the images, content-based classification of the cardiac images is essential to manage such databases. In particular, cardiac view classification is becoming an important stage for medical image analysis; efficient content-based retrieval as well as CAD systems. The major challenge in such classification lies in the large variability in image appearance caused by variation of patient-specific geometry, heart deformations, and disease conditions. In this work, a fully automated view classification of cardiac MRI images is presented. The method uses the autoencoder system for automatic feature extraction from a training dataset. A softmax classifier is used to determine the view from the selected features. Several autoencoder systems have been investigated in order to select the most suitable architecture for the problem. The results show that the proposed method outperforms current systems with orientation classification accuracy for Cine, SENC and Tagged MRI Imaging sequences was 96.7 %, 91.98 %, 100 % respectively. © 2014 IEEE.","Autoencoder; cardiac MRI; Softmax; View Calssification","Biomedical engineering; Classification (of information); Content based retrieval; Heart; Image classification; Learning systems; Medical imaging; Search engines; Auto encoders; Automatic feature extraction; Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging; Cardiac MRI; Classification accuracy; Content-based classification; Softmax; View Calssification; Magnetic resonance imaging","","","","","","","Trojacanec K., Dimitrovski I., Loskovska S., Content based image retrieval in medical applications: An improvement of the two-level architecture, EUROCON, 9, (2009); Yang W., Feng M.Y.Q., Lu Z., Gao Y., Xu Y., Chen W., Content-based retrieval of brain tumor in contrast-enhanced mri images using tumor margin information and learned distance metric, Medical Physics, 39, 11, pp. 6929-6942, (2012); Margeta A., Criminisi A., Lee D.C., Ayache N., Recognizing cardiac magnetic resonance acquisition planes, Medical Image Understanding and Analysis, (2014); Ebadollahi S., Chang S.-F., Wu H., Automatic view recognition in echocardiogram videos using parts-based representation, CVPR, 2004, (2004); Otey M.E., Bi A., Krishnan S., Rao B., Stoeckel A., Katz A., Han A., Parthasarathy S., Automatic view recognition for cardiac ultrasound images, MICCAI: IntI Workshop on Computer Vision for Intravascular and Intracardiac Imaging, (2006); Snare S.R., Aase S.A., Mjolstad O.C., Dalen H., Orderud F., Torp H., Automatic real-time view detection, IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium Proceedings, (2009); Zhou S.K., Park J.H., Georgescu B., Comaniciu D., Simopoulos C., Otsuki J., Image-based multiclass boosting and echocardiographic view classification, IEEE Computer Society Conference, (2006); Park J.H., Zhou S.K., Simopoulos C., Otsuki J., Comaniciu D., Automatic cardiac view classification of echocardiogram, ICCV, (2007); Zhou Y., Peng Z., Zhou X.S., Automatic view classification for cardiac mr, International Symposium of Eiomedical Imaging (ISE, (2012); Margetal A., Criminisi A., Lee D.C., Ayache N., Recognizing Cardiac Magnetic Resonance, (2014); Wael M., Fahmy A.S., Classification of cardiac magnetic resonance image type and orientation, International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP, (2014); Bengio Y., Courville A., Vincent P., Representation learning: A review and new perspectives, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 35, 8, pp. 1798-1828, (2013); Ngiam A., Coates A., Lahiri A., Prochnow B., Le Q.V., Ng A.Y., On optimization methods for deep learning, Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML-ll, (2011); Kramer M.A., Nonlinear principal component analysis using autoassociative neural net-works, AIChE Journal, 37, pp. 233-243, (1991); Bishop C.M., Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, (2006)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","7th Cairo International Biomedical Engineering Conference, CIBEC 2014","11 December 2014 through 13 December 2014","Giza","110277","","978-147994412-5","","","English","Proc.

The most commonly used transformation method uses a quadratic model to represent the geometry of the retinal surface. Although this model has been used for more than one decade, there is no literature that studies the model errors for abnormal eye geometries. In this work, we present a study of the registration errors of the quadratic model in case of diseased eyes. The study includes two basic models of the retinal surface for eyes suffering from: myopia; and retinal diseases (e.g. age related macular degeneration). In addition, real datasets of age related macular degeneration (AMD) patients have been used to quantify the registration error. The simulation results show that the average error can be as high as 13 pixels at extreme conditions of myopia and retinal diseases. For real datasets with typical disease conditions, the error was found to be 2.6 pixels. © 2014 IEEE.","Feature based methods; Quadratic model; Registration; Retinal images","Biomedical engineering; Errors; Image registration; Pixels; Age-related macular degeneration; Extreme conditions; Feature-based method; Quadratic modeling; Registration; Registration error; Retinal image; Transformation methods; Ophthalmology","","","","","","","Spaide R.F., Medical Retina Springer, (2004); Gilchrist J., Analysis of early diabetic retinopathy by computer processing of fundus images-a preliminary study, Ophthalmic Physiolog.

Laser is used to deposit optical energy (i.e., optical fluence) into a target. As a result, the target temperature changes and causes thermal expansion to the target that leads to generating a PA signal. One of the important parameters that control the PA is the elasticity of the target. In general, most the PA studies and image reconstruction algorithms for PAI assumes isotropic elasticity within the target. However, it is known that certain soft tissues, like muscles and glands, are anisotropic with respect to elastic deformation. Also, observations indicate that breast tumors tend to be anisotropic. This could affect the reconstruction of PA images. In this study, we have investigated the influence of the anisotropic elasticity on PA back-propagation imaging using finite element method. The Fluence distribution was estimated by solving light propagation within a tissue model using Monte Carlo method. The results show that the object may appear in the reconstructed image about 10% larger or 12% smaller than the expected size based on the distribution of the young's modulus within the object if its anisotropic elasticity was not considered in the reconstruction algorithm. © 2014 IEEE.","Anisotropic Elasticity; Finite Element Method; Monte Carlo Method; Photoacoustic Imaging","Anisotropy; Backpropagation; Biomechanics; Biomedical engineering; Elastic moduli; Elasticity; Finite element method; Image reconstruction; Monte Carlo methods; Photoacoustic effect; Thermal expansion; Tissue; Anisotropic elasticity; Anisotropic mechanical properties; Fluence distribution; Image reconstruction algorithm; Isotropic elasticity; Non-invasive imaging; Photo-acoustic imaging; Reconstruction algorithms; Medical imaging","","","","","","","Wang L.V., Tutorial on photoacoustic microscopy and computed tomography, IEEE J.
